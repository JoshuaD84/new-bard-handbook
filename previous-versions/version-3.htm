<h3>About the Bard</h3>
<p>
    This class is AWESOME. <strong>I think bard is one of the most balanced, dynamic, and fun classes to play in the game.</strong> I didn’t appreciate how
    many options and abilities were available to it until I dug into the various source books. Sure, you don’t have the raw power of the nuclear classes, but
    you can be in a party with other tier 2-5 classes and really shine. He can be adapted to a bunch of different play styles: caster, gish (sword-mage),
    arcane archer, face, crowd control, skill monkey, and healer. He can usually fill a number of those roles at the same time, and does so effectively.
</p>
<p>
    I have played a lot of different characters, and the bard is by far the most fun I’ve had. Wizards and things like the DMM Cleric possess campaign
    shattering nuclear power, but where’s the fun in that? The DM is pissed at you, the other players are pissed at you, and the campaign ends early. The bard
    is what D&amp;D should be: dynamic, rewards creative play, powerful without being over-powered, and his abilities are friendly to other PCs. I cannot
    recommend the class enough, especially for your next low- or mid-powered campaign.
</p>
<h3>
    <strong>Why I Wrote this Handbook</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    There is another good bard’s handbook on the net, but I found that it was missing a good bit of information, so I wanted to write a comprehensive handbook.
    That being said, the original handbook is a great resource, and I recommend reading that one as well as this one to get multiple view points.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Other Resources</h3>
<p>Here are some of the resources that helped me build this handbook:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>
        <a href="http://community.wizards.com/forum/previous-editions-character-optimization/threads/1145396">
            Dictum Mortuum - The Bard’s Handbook
        </a></strong> - The original handbook. Very good stuff here. 
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>
			<a href="http://www.minmaxboards.com/index.php?topic=8936.0">Endarire - Breaking Down Inspire Courage</a>
		</strong>. A handbook dedicated entirely to maximizing inspire courage, one of the best features of the Bard's class. Definitely worth a read. 
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong><a href="https://incontrol88.wordpress.com/2010/08/09/bardzilla/">Cards’n’Dice - Bardzilla</a></strong> - An interesting take on the bard. Not
		comprehensive, but a few good angles. 
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>
        <a href="http://community.wizards.com/forum/previous-editions-character-optimization/threads/1146876">
            Treantmonk - Guide to Being God (A wizard)</a></strong> - This doesn’t directly apply to the bard. However, he talks a lot about crowd control, area effects, and spell use, so this is a good read.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong><a href="http://brilliantgameologists.com/boards/index.php?topic=9876.0">Relentless Imp - Metamagic and you</a></strong>
		Very useful reference for metamagic feats. 
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>
        <a href="http://community.wizards.com/forum/previous-editions-character-optimization/threads/1121616">
            Dictum Mortuum – The Familiar’s Handbook
        </a>
		</strong>
		A good resource for bards who are going to get a familiar. Worth reading if you're thinking of going that direction. 
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>
			<a href="http://brilliantgameologists.com/boards/index.php?topic=3809">Caedrus – The Fear Handbook</a>
		</strong>
		For those bards who want to terrify their opponents, causing them to cower in the corner and cry like babies. 
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Color / Symbol Legend</h3>
<ul>
	<li class="rank-a">
		<strong>Best</strong> – This is a very strong option and is almost always the best choice, or one of the best choices.
	</li>
	<li class="rank-b">
		<strong>Strong</strong> – This is also strong, but you may or may not want to take it depending on your build.
	</li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>OK</strong> – This is a reasonable choice.
	</li>
    <li class="rank-d">
		<strong>Weak</strong> – This is either mechanically weak, or has a very narrow application. I don’t recommend taking this feature.
	</li>
    <li class="rank-e">
		<strong>Terrible</strong> – This is absolutely terrible or nearly unusable.
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>Source Books Used</h3>
<p>
    I used all of the official source books and also included some items from dragon magazines. The Dragon Magazines are a little more difficult to review
    comprehensively, so I included the peaks I could find, but may have missed some items. You should be warned that Dragon Magazine features are typically
    unbalanced and should be reviewed with a critical eye before being accepted into your campaign.
</p>

<h3>
    A Note on Ability Evaluation and Character Optimization
</h3>
<p>
    Many people focus on only level 20 only when they design characters. I recommend doing more than that.
</p>
<p>
    If your campaign is anything like the games I’ve ever played, you start at low levels, slowly progress through the mid levels, and, if you’re lucky, you
    get to play some teen levels before the game falls apart.
</p>
<p>
    Even if you have a dedicated play group and make it all the way to level 20, the abilities you get at levels 1-5 are going to get <strong>a lot</strong> 
    more play than the abilities you get at levels 15-20. Keep that in mind while designing your character. I recommend that you look at the build every four
    levels (or at specific key levels, depending on your class) and consider how you’d like the character at each of those level.
</p>
<p>
    If you know you’re going to start playing at a high level and continue to play after reaching level 20, then of course this does not apply to you. But for
    most people, level 1-10 are much more important than levels 11-20. Make sure you keep that in mind while developing your character. Remember; the goal
    isn’t to optimize some theoretical mechanic; the goal is to optimize fun.
</p>
<h3>Party Roles</h3>

<ul>
   <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Archer</strong>
       – I think the archer build bard is worse than the caster bard or the melee bard. That being said, it’s definitely a viable option.
    </li>
        <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Blaster</strong> – 
        The bard does not make a good blaster. He has a few direct damage spells on his list, but not many. (but That’s OK, because blasters suck anyway.)
    </li>
	<li class="rank-a">
        <strong>Buffer</strong> – This is the bard’s best role (and easiest to fulfill). Inspire courage is very strong, easy to make much stronger, and it’s one of your core class
        features. Your spells can support this role as well. Buffing is something the bard is always going to be good at (unless you actively work to make him
        bad at it). The bard has access to a poor-man’s version of the Paladin’s Divine Metamagic Feat, so 24-hour persisted buffs are also an option here, if
        you’re interested in that sort of thing.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Caster</strong> – The bard has a really solid selection of spells, particularly crowd control and social spells. He also has good access into the illusion school, which
        opens up a world of possibilities.
    </li>  
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Debuffer</strong> – 
        Aside from the good list of bard spells that debuffs opponents, the bard is a solid class for going into fear effects (see the fear handbook link
        above). The bard also gets access to Doomspeak (although at later levels), which is one of the strongest debuffs in the game.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Healer</strong>
       – The bard is the only arcane class that gets access to heal spells. I don’t tend to recommend taking them, but if your party is light on healing, you
        can do it. In either case, the bard should carry some wands of cure wounds to help heal between fights (he can activate them without chance of failure
        since the spells are on his class spell list).
    </li>
	<li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Melee</strong> 
       – You can become a pretty big powerhouse in melee, surprisingly. There are ways to get into full plate mail, dual-wielding can be good, and you can
        output a lot of damage using feats like knowledge devotion and snowflake wardance. Your hit points aren’t great, so you have to be a little careful not
        to get squished, but you can definitely develop your character to output a ton of melee damage. This direction really benefits from Metamagic Song and
        Persist spell, too.
    </li>
	<li class="rank-a">
        <strong>Social / Face</strong> – The bard makes an amazing social manipulator and face of the party. He can pump all of the social skills (except intimidate), he has a lot of
        social-related spells (charm, fascinate, suggestion, detect thoughts, etc.), and has some social related class-features. The more creative you can be
        in social situation, the more fun you’ll have playing this class.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Stealth / Skill Monkey</strong> – 
        The bard has three-quarters the skill points of a rogue, and a lot of good class skills. He makes a great stealther / skill monkey. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Tank</strong> – 
        The bard doesn’t make a great tank. Leave that to the fighter classes. You can output damage or manipulate the battlefield; let them get beat up while
        you play chess.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Class Features</h3>

<ul>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong> 
       – Getting access the longsword and shortbow is nice. The best thing here is the Whip, which can be used to trip opponents from a distance with some
        special advantages. You should definitely carry one and look for opportunities to use it. At higher levels, this will probably lose its appeal. At
        lower levels, it can be a really solid option. Also, a bard doesn’t suffer Arcane Spell Failure in light armor, which is very nice. (Elven Chain is a
        good idea once you can afford it, or halfweight drow armor [Forgotten Realms – Underdark source book] ).
    </li>
    <li class="rank-a">
        <strong>Spells</strong> – 
        A Bard’s spells are, of course, his strongest class feature. He has limited spells know and limited spells-per-day, so it is important to choose your
        spells wisely.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Bardic Knowledge</strong>
       – This is OK. There’s certainly nothing wrong with it, but I think there are better options if you’re taking alternate class features.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-a">
        <strong>Bardic Music</strong>
       – Along with spellcasting, this is the core of the bard class. There are many different kinds of bardic music. Before going into each one, here are
        some key points about Bardic Music:
		<ul>
			<li>
				Activation is typically a standard action.
			</li>
			<li>
				Some Musics require concentration to maintain, others do not. (The melodic casting feat helps mitigate this).
			</li>
			<li>
				A bard cannot cast spells, and cannot activate magical items by spell completion, spell triggers, or command words while maintaining a bardic music (but there are ways around this, see the melodic casting feat).
			</li>
			<li> 
				If a Bardic Music does not require concentration, you can swing your sword, run, or otherwise use your standard action while maintaining the song (very useful for Inspire Courage, for example).
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Countersong</strong> 
       – Because it takes a standard action to activate and only protects against sonic or language-dependant magical attacks, this is very weak. It’s
        possible to go an entire 20 level campaign and never have a situation where this is the right choice. It will be also virtually impossible to get this
        to protect against instantaneous effects. The one place it has some value is to try and break the effect of a continuous effect, but even then, it has
        to be a sonic or language based attack. I recommend swapping this out if you can.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Fascinate</strong> 
       – Fascinate gives -4 to spot &amp; listen, and keeps the target from taking any actions as long as they are not threatened. The ability is limited to
        one target per 3 levels. This feature isn’t that great, but it has some fun in-game applications. It is most useful as the pre-requisite for suggestion
        or mass suggestion. A creative bard with a reasonable DM can find some nice tricks with this ability.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-a">
        <strong>Inspire Courage</strong>
       – This is one of the best reasons to play a bard. +1 to attack and +1 to damage doesn’t seem like a lot, but when you do the math across an entire
        party, it adds up to <strong>a lot</strong> of extra damage. When you use feats, magical items, and additional bard levels to get this bonus higher, it
        becomes responsible for a metric ton of damage. Obviously, this ability is stronger in a party of physical combat characters, and weaker in party of
        casters. The best part about this is it makes your fellow players happy, because their characters are more effective. Win-Win.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Inspire Competence</strong>
        [Requires concentration] – This is pretty weak. A +2 to a single skill for a single ally, for maximum two minutes. There are better things if you’re
        using alternate class features.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Suggestion</strong>
       – This is a strong class feature. The big limitation it has (compared to the spell) is that you can’t use it in combat, because fascinate is a
        pre-requisite and you cannot fascinate in combat. On the other hand, the DC to resist this is almost certainly going to be higher than the spell’s,
        which is nice. Half-elf bards (or other bards with generous DMs) will want to look at getting the spell Suggestion (so you can use it in combat) and
        swapping out this feature for Command, which is a little weaker, but less restrictive in how it can be cast (and also not on the bard’s spell list).
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Inspire Greatness</strong>
       – This is a solid feature, if you manage to stay bard for 9 levels. It gives extra hit dice, a small fort bonus, and a bonus to attack rolls that
        stacks with inspire courage.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Song of Freedom [Requires concentration]</strong> 
       – You’ll probably want to multi-class out before getting this ability, but if you get up here, it’s nothing special. It will be useful occasionally.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Inspire Heroics</strong> 
       – Again, you’ll probably be out of the class before you get up here. If not, it is an alright ability that grants +4 to all saving throws.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Mass Suggestion</strong>
       – This is OK. Unfortunately, the requirement that the targets be fascinated is very limiting, both because it means this can’t be used in combat and
        because it limits the number of targets. “Mass” really means “handful” in this case.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Alternative Class Features</h3>
<p>
    The bard has some really nice options for alternative class features.
</p>
<ul>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Bardic Knack (PHB 2, p 35)</strong>:
        <em>Lose bardic knowledge, gain the ability to use half your class level in place of skill ranks</em>. This is solid. I recommend it over bardic knowledge, but you may want to use this class-feature-slot for something else.        <strong>It’s worth noting that if you’re going to be multiclassing early, the benefit of this ability is more limited,</strong> because the bonus is
        calculated based on bard level. I would rule that any Prestige Class that advances Bardic Knowledge would also advance this feature, but you will have
        to check with your DM for his ruling.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Bardic Sage (UA, p 49):</strong>
        <em>Adds additional spells and bonus to knowledge in exchange for a higher need for intelligence and reduced duration of Bardic music abilities.</em>
        This is interesting. If you can have a maxed-out charisma and a 16 intelligence (or 19 if you’re going into sublime chord PrC), this might be worth
        pursuing. The big upside is an extra spells known, which is typically a hard limitation for bards.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Divine Bards (UA, p 50)</strong>
        : <em>Wisdom used to determine if you can cast a spell, Charisma used for all other factors, some spells added to the bard spell list.</em> This makes
        the bard have to pump wisdom to 16, and wisdom is his one easy dump stat. The spells you gain are not exciting, skip this one.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Drow Bard (DU, p 57</strong>
        ): <em>Gain poison use; lose bardic knowledge and 1 bardic music use/day.</em> If you are a Drow and want poison use, this is a fine way to get it. The
        cost isn’t too steep. I don’t typically go this route, but I think it’s an OK option.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Gnome Bard Substitution Levels (RoS, p 147):</strong>
		<ul>
			<li class="rank-a">
				<strong>1st level: Gnome Cantrips</strong> <em>(Extra level 0 spells)</em> Gnome Cantrips effectively net you one free level 0 spell known. I normally recommend taking all three spells you are granted by this ability (prestidigitation, dancing lights, and ghost sounds) anyway, so this 3-for-2 trade is really a 1-for-nothing trade. That is, free!
			</li>
			<li class="rank-c">
				<strong>..and Counter Fear</strong><em> (replaces countersong)</em>:<em> </em>This isn’t great, but it comes together with gnome cantrips. Counter fear
				is about the same strength as Countersong (i.e. terrible). You’ll want to get a DM ruling to see if you can swap out “Counter Fear” for things you could
				normally swap out countersong for.
			</li>
	</li>
			<li class="rank-d">
    <strong>3rd level: Inspire Defiance</strong> <em>(gain resistance to mind-affecting stuff, lose inspire competence)</em> – +2 to saves against illusions
    and mind-affecting spells and effects is better than inspire competence, but I think there are better alternate class features to replace inspire
    competence (Song of the Heart!).
	</li>
	<li class="rank-d">
    <strong>6th level: Phantasmal Song</strong> <em>- fear-like song, lose suggestion</em> – The low distance and limited effect makes this nothing exciting.
	</li>
	<li class="rank-d">
    <strong>11th level: Secrets of Bardic Trickery</strong> - <em>lose a 4th level spell known, get new spells</em> – I wouldn’t recommend phantasmal image
    as one of your 4<sup>th</sup> level spells, and neither color spray nor touch of idiocy have much value at this level, in my opinion. If you are a gnome
    and you like phantasmal image, then this is a no-brainer; get two other spells for free. I think I pass, though.
	</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	
    <li>
        <strong>Half-Elf Bard Substitution Levels (Races of Destiny, p 157)</strong> 
    <ul>
	<li class="rank-a"><strong>1st level</strong>: Gain Soothing voice, no countersong</strong> – This is an amazing upgrade. If you are a half-elf, do it. If you’re not a half-elf, see
    if you’re DM will let you do it anyway.
	</li>
	<li class="rank-b">
	<strong>6th level</strong>: Gain Command, no suggestion</strong> – I think this is very strong. I recommend doing this and picking up suggestion as a spell. This
    way you can use suggestion in combat, and you also gain command.
	</li>
	<li class="rank-d"><strong>8th level: Secrets of the Diplomat</strong> - <em>(gain bonus spells, but lose 4th level spell known</em> – I don’t think this is worth doing.
    Sending is a pretty underwhelming spell. I’d like to pick up command, but not at the cost of a 4<sup>th</sup> level slot. If you like sending for some
    reason, then this becomes great.
	</li>
	</ul>
	</li>

    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Healing Hymn (CC, p 47):</strong>
        <em>lose fascinate, boost natural healing and healing spells</em>
        . – Fascinate is needed for suggestion, which is too strong to give up for this ability. However, if you’re swapping out suggestion (via half-elf sub
        levels or some other method) then swapping out fascinate for this is worth considering. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Hymn of Fortification (CC, p 47):</strong>
        <em>lose inspire competence, use bardic music to generate protection from evil type effects</em>
        - This is better than inspire competence, but there are even better options (Song of the Heart!)
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Fey Bard (UA, p 58</strong>
        ):
        <em>
            gain animal companion, nature sense, resist nature's lure, and wild empathy as a druid. Lose bardic knowledge, inspire courage, inspire competence,
            inspire greatness, and inspire heroics.
        </em>
        Mechanically, this is a big loss. This is an interesting way to roll your own ranger/caster, but I don’t endorse it.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Inspire Awe (DrM, p 13):</strong>
        <em>Gain ability to inspire awe instead of courage. </em>
        Opponents become shaken, with a chance at saving. Generally, this is a terrible exchange for Inspire Courage. A fear-based bard might want to look into
        this, though.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Inspire Hatred (EoE, p 21):</strong>
        lose inspire greatness, gain inspire hatred. Cause an opponent to hate and attack his ally unless he passes a will save? Sweet! I love the flavor, and
        it seems like a better use of a standard action than inspire greatness.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Inspire Turning (ECR, p 206):</strong>
        <em>
            Replace Inspire Competence with the ability to boost an ally's ability to turn undead by spending a bardic music attempt they gain +2 levels on
            their turn check.
        </em>
        If you are in a party where this is relevant, I think it’s definitely better than inspire competence. But there are better options for that class
        feature (Song of the Heart!)
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Lore Song (DS, p 8):</strong>
        <em>Give up bardic knowledge. Once per day (more at higher levels) add +4 bonus to an attack, save, or check roll.</em>
        Solid. Worth considering if you’re not going into Bardic Knack.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Mimicking Song (DS, p 8):</strong>
        <em>Give up countersong. Use bardic music to give allies a +2 bonus on move silently.</em>
        This is probably an upgrade. In-character, it’s a little funny to imagine, but I think of it as the bard generating a magical sound-cancelling wave. In
        either case, if you don’t have somewhere else to dump countersong, this is probably an improvement.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Music of Creation (Ecs p 34): (You can also take these as feats)</strong> 
    <ul>
	<li class="rank-c"><strong>Haunting Melody</strong> – This is either very strong or below average, depending on DM’s ruling. I think the fairest rendition of the ruling
    (that is, read as intended) is that this takes a standard action to activate. If so, it’s meh. If, instead, it “piggy-backs” any bardic music you activate
    (I think this is Read as written), then it can be very strong. You can see discussion on this topic here:
    http://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/63506/does-haunting-melody-use-a-standard-action/
	</li>
	<li class="rank-e">
<strong>Music of Growth</strong> – I can’t think of a use for this. Maybe in conjunction with Savage Bard and summon nature’s ally? Still seems weak.    
	</li>
	<li class="rank-c">
<strong>Music of Making</strong> – Doubling the duration of conjuration spells is nice. If you have a lot, you may want to consider taking this.    
	</li>
	<li class="rank-a">
    <strong>Song of the Heart</strong> – Take this. It is so good. +1 to Inspire Courage and bonuses to DCs to resist your other bardic musics. (Don’t
    replace inspire courage)
	</li>
	<li class="rank-d">
    <strong>Soothe the Beast (</strong>Replaces Inspire Competence) – This is OK, but seems worse than the things it replaces. 
	</ul>
	</li>
    <li>
        <strong>Planar Bard (PlH, p 29):</strong> 
        This is the sort of ability could be good in a very particular campaign. The things you give up aren’t exciting, so if the gains are something your DM
        tells you want, then go ahead.
		<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>3rd level: Planar Inspiration</strong><em> (can use music to protect people from planar effects), lose inspire competence</em>
		</li>
		<li>
		<strong>6th level: Planar Dissonance</strong><em> (can temporarily redirect portals to new locations), lose suggestion</em>
		</li>
		<li>
		<strong>12h level: Planar Discordance</strong><em> (can use bardic music as a precipitate breach spell), lose song of freedom</em>
		</li>
		</ul>

    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Repel Domination (ECR, p 206)</strong>  - 
        <em>Lose suggestion. +2 bonus on saves vs mind affecting spells and abilities of the undead, if you succeed in the save they become shaken.</em>
        This is weak. Suggestion is a strong ability; don’t give it up for this conditional, passive, and small advantage. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Savage Bard (UA, p 50)</strong> – 
        <em>Must be chaotic, good fortitude and will save, poor reflex. Modified skill and spell list. Illiterate.</em>
       – Illiteracy is sad. Gaining fort instead of reflex is nice. Losing prestidigitation is absolutely miserable. Losing read magic and summon monster is
        sad. On the whole, not worth taking.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Spellbreaker Song (CM, p 35</strong>
        ) – <em>Lose countersong, can use bardic music to disrupt casters, giving them 20% spell failure chance. </em>– This isn’t much of an improvement over
        countersong. The fact that it disrupts all casters is a big advantage, though, especially if you can sustain it throughout the combat (it doesn’t
        require concentration to maintain). 20% against two or three spell casters over a handful of turns is pretty nice.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Spellscale Bard Substitution Levels (RDr, p 110):</strong>
		<ul>
		<li class="rank-b">
			<strong>1st level: Draconic Bardic Knowledge</strong><em> (bonus on bardic lore checks involving dragons) – </em>A free upgrade for spellscale bards. No
    reason not to take it.
		</li>
		<li class="rank-e">
<strong>3rd level: Inspire Arcana</strong><em> (music gives +1 caster levels to allies) lose inspire competence</em> – Requires concentration to
    maintain. Y U C K.
		</li>
		<li class="rank-d">
    <strong>6th level: Superior Suggestion</strong><em> (higher DC's with suggestion)</em> – I don’t think this is worth taking. Spell slots are a precious
    commodity for a bard.
	</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Undead Bardic Knowledge (ECR, p 206)</strong>
        : <em>Replace Bardic Knowledge with specialized knowledge about the undead, works like normal bardic knowledge but with a +5 competence bonus.</em>
        Only good if you’re going to be in a campaign that’s all about undead. The big advantage to bardic knowledge is diversity, and this takes that away.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Ability Scores</h3>
<p>
    Your choice in ability scores is going to depend a lot on what sort of bard you want to be. A caster/face/control bard doesn’t need strength or dex, where
    a melee or archer bard is going to want some.
</p>
<p>
    A Bard generally wants a high charisma, a low wisdom, and a good balance between the other four abilities, depending on the direction you are going. Melee
    bards can skim on the charisma a little, if they want, to pick up some additional physical stats.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Strength</strong>
       – Depends on the build. A bard will do combat damage sometimes, so a 10-14 here, when possible, is nice. 
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Dexterity</strong>
       – This is highly build-dependent. AC and ranged attack is nice, and you have a lot of skills that get bumps from Dex, but economy will probably not let
        you dump a ton of points here. 10-12 feels about right, generally.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Constitution</strong>
       – Extra hit points are always helpful. 10-14 here seems good.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Intelligence</strong>
       – This stat is a sponge; give it everything you can that you don’t need in the other slots. Extra skills are really great.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Wisdom</strong>
       – This is the bard’s easy dump stat. The primary benefit a bard gets from wisdom is will saves and a bump to spot / listen. Weak.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-a">
        <strong>Charisma</strong>
       – At least 16, preferably 18. Charisma is the stat bards use for casting, giving the bard bonus spells per day and a higher DC for spells that have a
        save (many bard spells).
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Races</h3>
<h4>No Level Adjustment</h4>
<ul> 
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Aasimar,Lesser (PGtF template applied to Aasimar)</strong>  - 
        +2 to Wisdom, +2 to Charisma, Darkvision, and a small bonus to spot and listen. Not my first choice, but a solid race.
    </li>   
	<li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Dwarf</strong> 
        [Desert (UA 11), Dream(RoS 88), or Gold (DMG 171)] <strong></strong> – No big upside here, but if you want to be a dwarf, none of these offer CHA
        penalties, which is nice. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Elf, Star</strong> 
        (UEast p9)<strong></strong> – +2 Cha, -2 Con, Favored Class Bard, Normal Elf Stuff, Can ghost touch weapons at night. 
    </li>
	<li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Gnome</strong> - Not really an exciting race for a bard, despite the favored class.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Gnome, Whisper</strong> (RoS 94)- +2 Dex and Con, -2 Str and Cha.Silence is a nice spell like ability, but not for -2 CHA. Pass.        
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Goblin, Bhuka</strong> 
(Sand 39) – Not an exciting race in general, but the best way for a bard to be a goblin, because of no CHA loss and no level adjustment.        
    </li>
	<li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Gruwaar</strong> 
        (DR317 p25) - +2 to Dex and Cha, -2 Str and Wis. Small, 4 legs, fey, can cast disguise self 1/day. Darkvision. 
    </li>
	<li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Half-Elf</strong>
        (PHB) – Half-elves are really strong, assuming you have access to the alternate class features from RoD. The +2 to diplomacy, low light vision, and
        other minor race features are also pretty nice. I wouldn’t take this race without access to RoD, but I would seriously consider it in the context of
        those alternate class features.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Half-Elf (Jungle)</strong> - Same as half-elf, but you ca +2 to bluff and sense motive instead of diplomacy and gather info.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Half-Human</strong>
        (DMG 171) – Same as half-elf, but you lose the diplomacy bonus to gain longbow proficiency (Bard already grants longsword). I think this is a worse
        option, but something you can look at. You’ll have to get the DM to approve getting the alternate class features from RoD, but he really ought to.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Halfling, Strongheart</strong> 
        (FRCS 17)<strong></strong> – Bonus feat and a lot of the typical halfling fare. Not a bad choice. 
    </li>
	<li class="rank-a">
        <strong>Human</strong>
        (PHB) – As usual, human is the best option. Bonus feats, bonus skills, and free multi-classing. It’s got everything.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-a">
        <strong>Human, Silverbrow</strong>  (DrM 6) – Gain dragonblood subtype, featherfall 1/day (and more at higher levels), +2 to disguise, but lose bonus skill points. Solid.        
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Illumian</strong>
         (RoD 52) - A really interesting class, especially for melee rogues. If you take the Aeshkrau word, you can dump charisma as a stat. You lose a lot of
        the social skills this way, but it’s an idea. 
    </li>
	<li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Kobold</strong> [Regular (RoTD 39), Arctic (UA 10), Desert (UA 13), Earth (UA 17)] – A way to get the dragonblood subtype, which can help with draconic aura. Take a look at all
        4 to see which you like best if you go this route, all four are about the same strength. Another trick is to take this race and start with the dragonwrought feat. Be an old man and get +3 to all mental stats without the normal
        penalties to the physical stats. A little cheesy, and it effectively costs you two feats (compared to being human.)
    </li>
	<li style="background-color: #FFFF00">
        <strong>Other Dragonblood Races</strong>
    </li>
    <li style="background-color: #FFFF00">
        <strong>Magic-Blooded Template</strong> 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Raptoran</strong>
        (RotW 68) – No level adjustment and gain the ability to fly via race. Flying is cool. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Spellscale</strong> 
        (RotD 26) – Can transfer into spellscale race by undergoing a rite after level 1. +2 to Cha, -2 to Con. Low light vision, A cool ‘blood-quickening’
        ability that lets you get a range of race-based benefits each day.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>With Level Adjustment</h4>
<p>
    These are generally only worth looking at if your DM will allow you to do a Level Adjustment buyoff. Otherwise, losing levels of class progression just
    can’t be justified. Usually, these are most useful to look at when you’re starting a campaign in the teen levels and don’t mind being a little behind the
    rest of your party for a while.
</p>
<h4>+1 Level Adjustment</h4>
<ul>
    <li class="rank-a">
        <strong>Aasimar</strong>
        (RoD 92, MM209) - +2 Wis and Cha, Darkvision, some other small benefits. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Catfolk</strong>
        (RotW 92) - +4 dex, +2 cha, 40’ move, low light vision, +2 to listen and move silent, and +1 to AC. Not a bad package for a bard.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Celadrin</strong>
        (DR 350) – Bonuses to Chrisma and Dex, +4 to Sing, Dark vision, bonus to diplomacy, normal elf stuff. Not bad.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-a">
        <strong>Draconic Creature Template</strong>
        (Dr 149) - +1 AC, +2 Str, Con, and Cha, Dark vision and low light vision, +2 to intimidate, two claw attacks.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>D’hin’ni</strong> 
        (DR351 p54)–+2 Dex, +2 Cha, -2 Wis. Darkvision 60’, +1 bonus to saves, +2 to some sneaky skills, prestidigitation
        at will! I love prestidigitation.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Gnome, Chaos</strong> (RodS 86) – 
        +2 to Cha and Con, -2 to Strength. Some cool spell-like abilities. Not great.
    </li>
	<li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Jaebrin</strong> 
        (MMV 93) - +2 Cha, -2 Str. Low light vision. Immunity to enchantment spells and effects. +1 bonus to DC for enchantment spells she casts, +2 on
        perform, bluff, diplomacy, and appraise. A bite that does will damage. Not bad.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Mephling, Air</strong> 
(Planar 10) – Gain flying, small size, favored class bard, and a weakish breath weapon. +2 to Dex and Cha, -2 to int. Not bad, but not worth 1 LA.        
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>+2 Level Adjustment</h4>
<ul>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Adu’ja</strong> 
        (DR317 p22) – Be a plant. +2 to Charisma. Some other cool abilities, like +4 to diplomacy and perform (although minuses to bluff and sense motive).
        Heals fast when in sunlight and well watered.
    </li>
	<li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Domovoi</strong>
        (Frost 122) - +6 Cha and bonuses to most other stats. Get some spells. Interesting.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Dragonkin</strong> 
        (Dcn 151) – Might be an idea for a melee bard starting at higher levels. You get fly, +8 to strength, bonuses to other stats, are large, detect magic
        at will, 7AC and some other cool things.
    </li>
	<li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Elf, Drow</strong> 
        (MM 103, Und 10) – +2 to Charisma, Int, and Dex, -2 to con, spell resistance, spell-like abilities, and darkvision. You also get the normal elf stuff
        and sensitivity to bright light.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Satry</strong>
        (MM 219) - +2 to all stats but Strength. Bard is favored class. A lot of nice benefits, including +4 to perform and damage reduction.
    </li>
	<li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Yuan-Ti Pureblood (</strong>
        MM 262) - +2 CHA, Dex, and Int. Darkvision, some feats, special attacks, spell resistance.
    </li>


</ul>
<h4>+3 Level Adjustment</h4>
<ul>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Witchknife</strong> 
        (MM3 112)<strong></strong>  - +4 to cha and other stat boosts, sneak attack damage, psionic effect spell-like abilities. Maybe worth looking into if
        you’re starting the campaign at high levels.<strong> <u></u></strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>+4 Level Adjustment</h4>
<ul>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Doppleganger</strong> 
        (MM 68) - +2 to all stats, and a total of +4 to wisdom. Darkvision, extra bonuses to everything, detect thoughts as a special ability, and change shape
        as a special ability. If you’re playing a high-level campaign and can do LA buyoff, this <strong>might</strong> be worth looking into. Would be
        absolutely miserable at low-levels.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Pixie</strong> 
        (MM 236) - +6 to Cha, bonuses to other stats (but dumps strength) . Can fly, some Damage Reduction, gain Greater Invisibility.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Skills</h3>
<p>
    A bard has a relatively high number of skill points per level, and has access to a wide range of skills. The bard’s best skills are the social skills, but
    he also has some other interesting things going on:
</p>
<ul>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Appraise</strong>
– Not really worth getting. You can prevent NPCs from taking too much from you on sales / buys with a very stingy DM, but not really exciting.        
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Balance</strong> – 
        I don’t recommend putting any points in this. It may come up occasionally, but it’s hard to get a lot of value from points here. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Bluff</strong> 
       – This is a very strong skill. I like taking this, along with the other social skills, and maxing it out as much as possible. Five ranks grant a +2
        synergy bonus to Diplomacy, which is great. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Climb</strong> 
       – If you like this for flavor, it gives the DM opportunities to give you cool dungeons. It doesn’t tend to give you the ability to beat general
        encounters, so I don’t recommend picking it up. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Concentration</strong>
       – Since you’re a spellcaster, this is essential (unless you pick up the feat Melodic Casting, in which case you can ignore this one).
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Craft</strong> 
– I don’t like using finite skill points to generate gold (a DM-controlled resource). For that reason, I don’t recommend taking this skill.        
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Decipher Script</strong> – 
        It’s less expensive to take read magic as a cantrip and learn all of the languages through “Speak Languages” than it is to get this up to a level where
        you can get any practical use out of it. Pass. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-a">
        <strong>Diplomacy</strong> – 
        One of the best skills in the game, I recommend maxing this out. It gives you so many opportunities to resolve conflicts and get allies. Very dynamic,
        very strong.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Disable Device (Cross-class)</strong>
       – This is an OK skill, but its cross-class for the Bard. I think there are better places to put your points. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Disguise</strong>
       – This has some cool role-playing opportunities, and can add a lot of flavor to a campaign. The downside is that the mechanics aren’t super favorable
        to the player, and the times you’ll be able to apply it in a regular campaign aren’t too often. It’s OK. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Escape Artist</strong> – 
        Being grappled sucks, and Escape Artist can help you get out of that. If your DM is good at the rules, he’ll probably send a few grapplers at the
        casters. This can help mitigate that.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Forgery (Cross-class)</strong> 
       – Because this is cross-class, it’s hard to get much out of it. It’s a cool ability with a lot of uses, so that’s cool.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Gather Information</strong> 
       – This is a fine ability, and fits right in with the other social-skills I recommend. It might overlap a bit, but with a good DM, I think each social
        skill has its own realm. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Handle Animal (Cross-class)</strong>
       – Not really worth putting points into. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Heal (Cross-class)</strong>
       – Not really worth putting points into.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Hide</strong> - 
        This is an OK skill for every class. You can go on espionage missions with the rogue, if you’d like. Not amazing, not bad. 
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Intimidate (Cross-class)</strong>
       – It’s a shame this skill is cross-class. It overlaps with diplomacy a bit, but I think it has some unique uses, and is really cool for roleplaying.
        There aren’t many easy ways for a bard to get a class skill, and because of the overlap with diplomacy, I think this is a pass. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Jump</strong>
       – Five ranks gives a bonus to tumble, and there’s a nice skill trick which can be good. Otherwise, I don’t think there’s much here worth pursuing this
        one. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Knowledge</strong>
       – Knowledges are a good skill in general, and become absolutely insane in conjunction with knowledge devotion and the skill trick Collector of Stories.
        If you’re going pure caster, this can be a dump. If you’re going archer or melee, this seems like something to really consider. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Listen</strong>
       – This is a good skill that will get a lot of use throughout any campaign. Wisdom is our dump stat, which is sad. I usually want more active things
        (and leave the listening to the barbarian or rogue) but this is definitely worth considering. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Move Silently</strong>
– Same as hide. If you and the rogue want to be buddies (or if there's no rogue) this is maybe worth taking. It has some application, but not as many as you might like.        
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Open Lock (Cross-class)</strong>
– This might be worth taking one rank in, if you get bardic knack. Otherwise, leave the locks to the rogues, wizards, or barbarians to solve.        
    </li>
    <li class="rank-a">
        <strong>Perform</strong>
       – Essential for a bard. Max this out at least once. I recommend doing something that doesn’t require an instrument, like singing, whistling, or
        oration.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Profession</strong>
       – Boring. If you want to say to your DM “I spend a year making money”, then go ahead. Not something I’m interested in doing. Kill monsters and fight
        bad guys. That’s more fun. Professions are for real life. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Ride (Cross-class)</strong>
       – Dump this skill and avoid horses. Q E D. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Search (Cross-class)</strong> – 
It’s a good skill, but it’s not our strong suit. I usually let someone else in the party cover this ground, and just assist when I can.        
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Sense Motive</strong> - 
        Five ranks gives a synergy bonus to diplomacy. That’s great. Otherwise, it does help protect the party from being bluffed. It’s a solid skill, but not
        amazing. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Sleight Of Hand</strong>
       – A lot of the bard’s spells are social based, and being caught casting can really a limiting factor. Sleight of hand enables you to cast secretly in
two ways (using the skill and using a skill trick), which I’ll outline below in a special section. For that reason, I love this skill.        
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Speak Language</strong> 
       – A lot of the bard’s skills and spells are language dependent. The more languages you speak, the more opportunities you have to use those skills.
        There is a strong argument that this skill is not subject to the normal “Max level + 3 ranks” limit, which means you can pick up all 19 learnable
        languages at a pretty low level. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Spellcraft</strong>
       – Not especially useful for a bard, but it’s a good general skill that will have a lot of applications. I recommend picking this up at later levels
        (especially if you go into a Prestige Class that has it as a class skill and requirement). 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Spot (Cross-class)</strong>
       – A good skill that I leave to other PCs. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Survival (Cross-class)</strong>
– Cross class and limited application. It will only really solve problems by the most difficult and strict DMs. Leave this to the ranger or rogue.        
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Swim</strong> - 
        This skill can save your life, but you don’t typically need a bunch of points to get value from it. As DM, I like to make encounters that reward
        multiple types of skills, and swim is easy to do that with. But it’s not something you need. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Tumble</strong> - 
        If you’re a melee bard, this is great. If you’re an archer bard, it might be OK. If you’re a face / caster bard, pass. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-a">
        <strong>Use Magic Device</strong>
       – Another of the best skills in the game, I also recommend maxing this out, but you don’t need it at all for the first few levels of the game.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Use Rope (Cross-class)</strong>
– This is a pet skill for a lot of people, but the uses are kind of limited and it’s cross-class. I think you can safely pass on this one.        
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Skill Tricks</h3>
<p>
    Skill tricks are a game feature from Complete Scoundrel. They let you spend 2 skill points to pick up “skill tricks”, which are effectively mini-feats. Due
    to the high number of skill points and many roles that a Bard can play in a party, skill tricks can be a nice resource for a bard. Typically, you want to
    choose skill tricks that suit your character. Two skill points aren’t a large investment, so if you’ll be able to get some use out of the trick, it’s
    generally worth taking. Here is a list and my opinions on each:
</p>
<ul>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Acrobatic Backstab</strong>
       – This is best for a rogue, but if you’re a melee bard who uses tumble a lot, it’s not a bad use of skill points.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Assume Quirk</strong>
       – Usually, if you’re using disguise, someone who knows the person you’re pretending to be is going to be in your line of fire. Getting a +4 to +10 on
        disguise in this scenario is a pretty good investment of two skill points. This will typically be best for someone who maxed out disguise and wants
        more points. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Back on Your Feet</strong>
       – Really strong vs trip attacks. If I’m a melee / tumbler class, I’m taking this. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Clarity of Vision</strong>
       – This is strong if you don’t have the ability to see invisibility some other way. The fact that you only get one round per encounter isn’t super
        exciting, though. If you somehow have 12 ranks in spot, this is a fine pick up. Because spot is a cross-class skill for bard, this is hard to get.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Clever Improviser</strong>
       – This one just doesn’t get enough bang for the buck, especially for a non-rogue. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Collector of Stories</strong>
       – This is solid if you don’t metagame. It’s especially strong if you’re a combat bard who takes knowledge devotion (and your DM rules that the +5 bonus
        improves your Devotion roll.) I take this as a combat bard and pass as a caster bard.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-a">
        <strong>Conceal Spellcasting</strong> – 
        I think this is great for any bard. Most of our spells are going to be social spells, and being able to cast without detection helps a lot. You should
        also look at Races of Stone (Page 133) for additional info on concealed spellcasting with sleight of hand. (Additional info here:
        http://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/63128/conceal-spellcasting-skill-or-skill-trick/)
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Extreme Leap</strong>
       – This is a fine pick up for any tumbler bard. No skill entry cost (because you almost certainly have 5 jump for the synergy) and you get a little
        extra move when needed as a swift action. Not amazing, not bad. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>False Theurgy</strong>
       – I don’t typically run into counterspellers. If you do, this can be good to make sure a spell gets through. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Group Fake-Out</strong> – 
I don’t think feinting is terribly good. For that reason, I also pass on this. If you’re into feinting, this is a fine upgrade for a low cost.        
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Healing Hands</strong> - 
        A mini-heal spell when dealing with dying characters. Can really help in a low-magic campaign, but this gets eclipsed by a Wand of CLW pretty quickly.
        Not great, and not really for a bard. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Hidden Blade</strong>
       – Don’t take quick draw as a feat. If you have it, I guess you can take this feat. But I have trouble seeing this come up more than once in an entire
        campaign. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Leaping Climber</strong>
       – I have trouble thinking of a scenario where speedy climbing is necessary, and where a few feet is the difference that matters. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Listen to This</strong> - 
        The best use of this is to bring non-understood languages back to the guy who can understand them. But you ARE the guy who can understand them. Spend
        the skill points on speak languages, not this. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-a">
        <strong>Magical Appraisal</strong> - 
        Upgrade detect magic to Identify, yes please! 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Mosquito’s Bite</strong>
       – Most bad guys act like they didn’t get hit anyway, and why would a bard be using a light weapon? Pass. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Never Outnumbered</strong> – 
        We don’t have intimidate, this range is low, and demoralize opponent isn’t a great use of a standard action. Pass.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Nimble Charge</strong>
       – This seems pretty good for a melee bard. A little narrow, but no real downside. The way its worded makes it sound like a passive always-on ability,
        but the general rule for skill tricks is once-per-encounter. I would want the DM’s ruling on that question, but it seems OK. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Nimble Stand</strong> – 
        Not bad, butI’d get Back on your Feet instead.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Opening Tap</strong> 
       – Not for the bard. Not even great for a rogue<strong>.</strong> 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Point it Out</strong> – 
        A high entry cost, a bard isn’t typically the Spot guy in the party, and the effect is pretty limited. I’d pass.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Quick Escape</strong> – 
        Getting out of a grapple or pin at a swift action is really nice. This ability isn’t worth 14 skill points, but if you have the escape artist already,
        this is probably worth picking up. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Quick Swimmer</strong>
       – I have trouble imagining a scenario where this matters at all.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Second Impression</strong> – 
        If you’re all about disguise, this is good. In general, it seems a bit loose for 2 skill points.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Shrouded Dance</strong>
       – This has no application for a bard. Pass. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Social Recovery</strong> – 
        This isn’t too strong, but it pumps your diplomacy a little if you also have a maxed out bluff. I would spend two skill points to increase my diplomacy
        by 1 above maximum, so I think this a fine take. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Slipping Past</strong>
       – The problem this skill trick solves doesn’t happen often enough to matter.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Speedy Ascent</strong>
– Same as quick swimmer and jumping leap. Unless you’re simulating a climbing competition, when is this going to make an actual difference?        
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Spot the Weakness</strong>
       – Not a bad skill trick. It helps vs the big armored guy a lot. Bards don’t tend to have a good spot skill, so this might not be great for you unless
        you picked up spot as a class skill from somewhere else. If you did, it’s worth considering at least. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Sudden Draw</strong>
       – Don’t take quick draw. If you did, and you imagine this scenario will ever arise, you can spend two skill points for a really cool story.
        Mechanically, this is very weak. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Swift Concentration</strong> – 
        This is strong if you have spells that require concentration to maintain. It effectively gives you one more standard action, if you like those spells
        otherwise. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Timely Misdirection</strong>
       – So many ifs and conditions. Pass on this please.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Tumbling Crawl</strong> – 
        This is a good ability; anytime you can get out of reach of AOOs safely is nice. I just have trouble seeing it come up often. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Twisted Charge</strong>
       – This is solid for any melee bard. Not amazing, but just solid. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Up the Hill</strong> – 
        Like the swim and climb skill tricks, I just don’t see this making an appreciable difference. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Walk the Walls</strong> 
– This has such cool visuals. I don’t know when you’ll get a good use out of it (you need a perfect scenario) but man its super cool.        
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Wall Jumper</strong>
       – I have trouble finding a use for this. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Whip Climber</strong> 
       – I’d love to be Indiana Jones, but 15’ reach on a whip plus a 7 skill point dump feels rough.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Prestige Classes &amp; Multiclassing</h3>
<p>
    An optimized bard is a multiclassed bard. There are a lot of options here, especially considering the different roles it might want to be. I’ve tried to
    make as large of a list as possible, but there are a lot of options out there, so I may have missed a few of the more obscure ideas.
</p>
<h4>Base Classes</h4>
<p>
    There aren’t a ton of great base-class dips for a bard. That being said, there are a few worth considering, and there are others which aren’t bad and might
    be fun for flavor, or fit a particular character you’re trying to build.
</p>
<ul>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Beguiler</strong>
        (PHB2 7) – Same as rogue, but instead of sneak attack you get some cantrips and level 1 spells. Not worth setting back all of your bardic class
        features. Pass.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Binder</strong>
        (ToM 9) – This is a cool class, but I don’t see any benefits to cross-classing into it.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Cleric</strong>
       – Probably the best general single-dip base class in the game. You get a bunch of really cool effects. There is a handbook for this:
        (http://brilliantgameologists.com/boards/index.php?topic=2773.0)
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Crusader</strong> 
        (ToB:BoNS 8) –Strong for a melee bard. You get access to a white raven stance, which you can use to pick up White Raven Tactics feat,
        giving you Inspire Courage as a swift action. You also get maneuvers, can delay taking damage to yourself, and you gain some extra damage output
        tricks. You get a lot of punch from in a single level dip into this class.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Dragonfire Adept</strong>
        (DM ) – This class is similar to the warlock in mechanics. I don’t see any advantage to going into this; it doesn’t directly synergize or amplify any
        bard class features.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Dragon Shaman</strong> 
        (PHB2 12) – A one level dip gets you 3 draconic auras, and +2 to fort and will. Not good, but if you really like draconic auras this is OK.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Fighter</strong> 
        (PHB) – Not worth going into for the bonus feat, IMO. Progressing your bardic music or going into crusader will be better.
    </li>
    <li style='background-color: #ffff00' >
        <strong>Marshal</strong>
        (MH )<strong></strong>  - 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Monk</strong>
        (PHB) – Unless you’re doing this for flavor reasons, pass.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Paladin</strong> 
        (PHB) – Definitely weaker than progressing bard alone, or going into Crusader / Cleric, but there is one feat that supports this build, so it’s green
        instead of red. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Ranger</strong>
        (PHB) – There’s really nothing here for a bard. Not worth dipping for combat style (you’re better off doing that with fighter and it’s not good).
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Rogue</strong> – 
        Sneak attack is nice, but its only 1d6. I don’t recommend dipping this class, and multiclassing for a number of levels will just set back your bardic
        music and casting. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Swordsage</strong> 
(ToB:BoNS 15) – Doesn’t give access to White Raven stances, which is a big benefit to going into this book. I recommend Crusader or Warblade instead.        
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Warblade</strong> 
        (ToB:BoNS 20) – Also good for a melee bard. You get access to white raven stance (opening up the feat white raven tactics, letting you inspire courage
        as a swift action) and some bonuses to reflex saves. Not as good as crusader for the bard, but still strong.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Warlock</strong>
        (CArc 8) – Not worth dipping into. You just get an eldrich blast, which is a flashy long-bow. You have much better things to do with 1 level.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Bard Specific</h4>
<p>
    These are going to tend to be the strongest prestige classes available, because they are designed to continue to improve or enhance your bardic musics.
</p>
<ul>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Dirgesinger</strong> 
        (LM p43)<strong></strong> – Become a bardic necromancer. Lose bardic spell progression, get access to five new songs across five levels, all undead
        related. Some of the songs (Sorrow, Grief, Horror, Awakening) are pretty strong. Losing spell progression is sad, but this is cool to look into,
        especially for a fear bard. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Dawncaller</strong> 
        (RoS 103) –Must be a goliath. No spell progression. Pick up some barbarian-like bardic musics. Not great, maybe worth considering as
        a two-level dip to get another +1 to inspire courage and darkvision. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Divine Prankster</strong> 
        (RS 107) - Must be a gnome.Get full spell progression, good reflex and will saves, wizard BAB progression, and some
        cool additional bardic musics. Definitely worth looking into for the gnome bards out there. 
    </li>
    <li style="background-color: #ff0" >
        <strong>Dwarven Chanter</strong> (Web) -
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Evangelist</strong> 
        (CD 39) – Lose bardic spell progression. Pick up some OK bardic musics and skill abilities. Has a bad feat entry cost, and no spell progression.
        Mechanically, this is weak. 
    </li>
    <li style="background-color: #ff0" >
        <strong>Hafling Whistler</strong>
        (Web) -
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Harper Agent</strong>
        <strong>(</strong>
        PGtF 58) – Continues to progress bardic knowledge, and increases spells levels 2-5. Otherwise, the abilities it is granted are pretty weak and it
        requires a crappy feat to get in. Pass. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Heartfire Fanner</strong> 
(DrM #314) – Give allies feats, give a little bigger boost to an ally under inspire courage, and get full casting and full music progression. Solid.        
    </li>
    <li class="rank-a">
        <strong>Lyric Thaumaturge</strong> 
        (CM 67) – This is a great class. It is a good alternative to the basic bard progression. You can start taking it at level 7, which is a good break
        point in the bard class, and it lets you pick up some spells from the wizard list, some extra spells per day, and a few other cool abilities. Level 4
        and level 7 are natural break points, but there’s nothing wrong with going all the way to level 10. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Ollam</strong> 
        (Cadv 66)– A Dwarf only class that grants some bard-like abilities. 5 levels total, levels 2,3, and 4 improve spellcasting.
        Definitely a pass. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Seeker of the Song</strong> 
        (CA 56) – Lose bardic spell progression, but pick up a lot of special bardic musics, plus the ability to combine bardic musics and activate musics as a
        swift action. If you want to go all-in on bardic music, this is a good class to do it with. Requires Skill Focus (Perform) as an entry feat, which is
        sad. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Stormsinger</strong> 
        (Frost 71) – Full spell progression and some additional bardic musics. Requires two bad feats for entry, though, which is a real bummer. I haven’t
        looked at this too deeply, but I feel like there’s the potential for abuse by maximizing the winds ability. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-a">
        <strong>Sublime Chord</strong> – 
        Get up to 9<sup>th</sup> level spell casting with this class, plus some cool abilities. Entry cost isn’t too high. It pulls spells from the wizard /
        sorcerer list or bard list, whichever is better. A great 2-level dip or 6-level dip. (Then you’ll want to use something that progresses spellcasting to
        get to 10<sup>th</sup> level casting of this). 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Troubadour of the Stars</strong> 
        (BoED 78) – Requires a weak feat to get in and progresses spells every even level. It stacks with bard for progresses all bardic music abilities,
        though, which is nice. You also pick up detect evil at will some additional bardic musics, and some other cool abilities. Worth looking at if you want
        to be a bard/paladin type character. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-a">
        <strong>Virtuoso</strong> – 
        Can be used to increase the spellcasting levels of sublime chord, or of bard. Very strong class that also gives some cool bardic music abilities. You
        have to give up one level of spellcasting to get into this, but you get full progression after that plus the musics. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>War Chanter</strong> 
        (CW p87)– Lose bard spell progression, pick up strong alternate combat-oriented bardic music abilities. It’s a shame that we lose
        spells with this class. 
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Combat Bards</h4>
<ul>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Abjurant Champion</strong> 
        (CM 50)<strong></strong> – Five level full casting class and full BAB that grants some really cool abjuration-related effects. Bards don’t tend to have
abjuration spells, though, so the application for us is limited. (Dispel magic and resistances are the only good spells on the bard list).        
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Arcane Archer</strong> – 
Elf or Half-elf only. Lose spell progression and bard ability progression. Pick up some really cool arrow tricks. Not strong, but it has nice flavor.        
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Eldritch Knight</strong> 
        (DMG 187) – Lose one level of casting progression and bardic music progression for full BAB and a bonus feat. Worth looking at, probably not worth
        taking. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Knight Phantom</strong> 
(Five Nations 41)<strong></strong> – Lose bardic music progression to pick up full BAB and some ghost-flavored abilities. Not bad, not great.        
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Spellsword</strong>
       – No bardic progression, and only 1/2 spell progression. Not a good fit for a bard
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Suel Archanamach</strong> 
(CArc 63) – Starts its own spell progression, and adds some combat<strong></strong> - related feats. Not great, but might be worth looking at once.        
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Spell Progression / Abilities (Not Bard Specific)</h4>
<p>
    These are notable classes that continue spell progression and grant some abilities, but don’t progress your bard-specific abilities.
</p>
<ul>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Archmage</strong>
        (DMG 178)<strong></strong> – Three bad feats to get in and no bardic progression. The High Arcanas are kind of cool, but not really worth the cost for
        a bard. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Ardent Dilettante</strong> 
        (Planar 55) – Progress spells at every level but first. Really high entry cost that increase as you level up in the class, but some nifty benefits (3
        bonus feats), and it progresses Bardic Knowledge. This class is going to be one that you have focus your entire build on, but it’s got some things to
        recommend it. I don’t think it’s the most powerful choice, but it might be fun. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Blood Magus</strong> 
        (CA 26)<strong></strong> – A casting focused class that progresses spells but offers nothing to the bard.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Exalted Arcanist</strong>
        (BoED 61) – Gain some exalted spells. The feat entry here, and losing one level of casting, is sad. I’m not in love with the new spells it gives you
        access to, so I think this is a pass. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Fatespinner</strong> 
        (CA 37)<strong></strong> – A high level prestige class that’s great as a 4-level dip. You stop improving your bardic knowledge and bardic musics per
        day, but you get a bunch of really cool re-rolling abilities. I love this class. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Green Star Adept</strong> 
        (CArc 41) – 5 / 10 spell progression. Slowly turn into a construct. Nothing special for a bard. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Harper Paragon</strong> 
        (PGtF 181) –Requires that you get into the vow feat tree.Doesn’t progress any bardic features, but gets you into
        some paladin / ranger like abilities while continuing to progress spells. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Heartwarder (FaP 197)</strong> – 
Stop progressing bardic music, but gain bonuses to charisma and charisma related effects, as well as full spellcasting progression. Pretty cool.        
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Incantatrix</strong> 
        (PGtF 61) – 10 levels of spell progression. No bardic ability progression. Pick up some cool concentration and metamagic tricks. I don’t think there’s
        much here for a bard, it’s better for a wizard or sorcerer. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil</strong>
        (CA 44) <strong></strong>  - This is a very strong class, but it’s got a high cost to get into and doesn’t fit the bard mold well. Leave this one to the
        wizards. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Loremaster</strong> 
        (DMG 191) – 10/10 spell progression, no bardic ability progression. Pick up “secrets” that give some minor benefits. This is weak. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Mage of the Arcane Order</strong>
        (CA 48) – This could be cool for a bard to get access to a wider range of spells, but it was designed without spontaneous casters in mind. You’ll have
        to talk to your DM about how to make it work. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Master of Masks (CS 52)</strong> – 
        Only progress spells 4 levels out of 10. You get a lot of neat abilities and some really cool flavor, but mechanically you give up a lot more than you
        gain.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Mindbender</strong> – 
        A reasonable good 1-level dip or 3-level dip. You only progress spell casting on odd levels, but you pick up cool abilities like telepathy.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Rainbow Servant</strong> 
        (CD 54) – If this grants access to all cleric spells at level 10, its worth looking at. I don’t think it’s good, anyway, but anything that expands the
        bard spell list is interesting. You get 7 levels out of 10 of spell progression, and some cool special abilities.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Ruathar</strong> 
        (RotW 122)<strong></strong> – Three levels of spell progression and some cool abilities. It doesn’t do anything to advance your bard skills, and the
        abilities aren’t that cool. Probably a pass.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Shadowcraft Mage</strong>
        (ROS 120) – 5 / 5 spell progression plus cool abilities. Must be gnome (or your DM can add a different restriction). Offers an effectively wider spell
        selection through shadow tricks. It’s pretty cool. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Shadowcrafter</strong> 
        (UD 43)<strong></strong> – An illusion-oriented casting class. 10/10 levels of spell progression, plus pumps to the Shadow spells. This isn’t great,
        but it’s OK.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Tainted Scholar</strong>
        (HoH 114) – Full spell progression, but requires a will save to multiclass out of. A lot of taint-flavored stuff here. I don’t recommend this on power
        level, and the taint stuff can be restrictive. If you like the flavor, take a look at it. (But it’d probably be better to do this as a pure caster
        class instead of the bard).
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Urban Savant</strong> 
        (City 100) – Full spell progression. You have to pick up the “favored” feat, which is pretty weak. Grants a mini-knowledge devotion class feature, you
        also pick up low-light-vision and some substitution skills for diplomacy. This is generally pretty weak.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Wild Mage</strong> 
        (CA 68)<strong></strong> – 10/10 spell progression. Not terrible, not exciting. If you like the flavor, it’s OK to take. There are stronger options,
        though. 
    </li>
    <li style="background-color: #ff0" >
        <strong>Nightmare Spinner</strong>
    </li>
    <li style="background-color: #ff0" >
        <strong>Dread Witch</strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Racial Paragons</h4>
<p>
    These classes are from Unearthed Arcana. These don’t prove to be a good option in the end, but it took me a lot of trying to fit them into builds to come
    to that conclusion. The +2 boost to a stat is a real big temptation, but it’s not worth losing bardic ability progression and a level of casting (or
    worse). That being said, maybe you have a build where they make sense, or you like the flavor, so I included them here.
</p>
<ul>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Drow Paragon (male only)</strong>
       – A one level dip is worth considering. Not great because it doesn’t advance any other classes or class abilities, but you do get spellcasting and
        additional uses of spell-like abilities.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Elf Paragon</strong> – 
        Doesn’t advance bard spells. Pass.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Gnome Paragon</strong> – 
        Not bad, but you lose one level of spellcasting.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Half-Elf Paragon</strong>
       – At best a two-level dip, which avoids the primary reason to take a paragon class: the stat boost. Pass.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Human Paragon</strong>
       – 3 levels, two of which progress spellcasting. Gain a bonus feat and +2 to a stat. Not bad, but usually hard to work into builds.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Hybrid Classes</h4>
<p>
    I don’t tend to think hybrid classes are a good idea from an optimization point of view, especially if you’re coming from the bard as a base class. You’ll
    see that reflected in the analysis below.
</p>
<ul>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Arcane Hierophant</strong> 
        (RotW 108) – Designed as a Arcane / Druid hybrid, a bard could theoretically go into this. I recommend passing, though, there’s nothing too exciting
        here. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Arcane Trickster</strong>
        (ToB 47)<strong></strong> – Mage / Rogue hybrid. Pros:Full sneak attack progression and full spell progression. Cons: This is built
        targeting a wizard, not a bard, so no bardic abilities progress. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Bladesinger</strong> 
        (RoF 179) – A lot of required entry feats, most of which are bad. It also has its own 4-level spell list rather than progressing the bard’s. There’s
        one really cool ability, but this is a pass. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Daggerspell Mage</strong> 
        (Cadv 31) – Arcane / Rogue hybrid. 9/10 spell level progression, sneak attack progression, and some cool knife like abilities. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Divine Prankster</strong> 
        (RoS p107) – A gnome-only Bard/Cleric hybrid PrC that focuses on Perform (Comedy). It gets a really powerful ability at 2<sup>nd</sup> level, that lets
        you consume a turn/rebuke undead attempt to get +10 against the check to recognize a figment as an illusion. The first thing that comes to mind are the
        shadow evocation and shadow conjuration spells. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Enlightened Fist</strong> 
        (CA 34) - Arcane /Monk – 8/10 spell progression, continued progression of monk abilities, some cool abilities. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Fochlucan Lyrist</strong> 
        (Cadv 47)–Bard / Druid hybrid.You progress Bard and Druid spell progression, along with bardic
        class features. You can’t get into the class until level 10, though, which means you are going to have a lot of lower-level spells, but be severely
        gimped at higher level spells. You also don’t get the best features of the druid class. I think this is worse than going pure bard or pure druid, but
        that’s how things often are with hybrid classes. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Geomancer</strong>
        (CD 41) – Divine / Arcane hybrid. Progresses one side of the spellcasting and adds some abilities.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Imaskari Vengeance Taker</strong> 
        (Underdark 37) – Gain sneak attack and poison use, 5/10 spell progression. Can seek out one particular creature using clairvoyance and divination. Not
        really anything special here for a bard. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Mystic Theurge</strong>
        (DMG 192)<strong></strong> – Arcane / Divine hybrid. Progress bardic spells and divine spells simultaneously, no other benefits. Not a good idea for a
        bard. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Rage Mage</strong>
        (CW 72) – Wizard / Barbarian hybrid. This doesn’t really seem to be worth anything to the bard. Just included it here in case someone is looking to do
        bard / barbarian. 
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Feats</h3>
<p>
    If your DM will let you take a flaw (see: Unearthed Arcana) take one. If he’ll let you take two, take two. More feats more better.
</p>
<h4>General Feats</h4>
<ul>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Battle Caster</strong> 
– You can put a bard in mithril full plate this way. Pretty cool. (You could also look into half-weight armor, to accomplish this without a feat).        
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Darkstalker</strong> 
        (LoM) – Hide a little better vs. creatures with blindsight and blind sense? Terrible. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Daunting Presence</strong> 
       – Standard action to activate, single target, gets a save, and benefit is minimal. Pass. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Imperious Command</strong> 
(DotU)<strong></strong> – Requires intimidate 8 ranks, and depends on demoralizing in combat, which is a bad use of a standard action. Skip this.        
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Improved Initiative</strong> – 
        This is a solid feat. Bards are buffers / controllers, and that means they like acting first. That being said, there are usually better options unless
        you are restrained on what books you can use. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Jack of All Trades</strong> – 
        This isn’t great at all. Dump one point in the skill if you really want access to it. Not worth a feat. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-a">
        <strong>Leadership</strong> 
       – Most DMs ban this feat, and for good reason. A bard is particularly good for this feat. It requires a lot of book-keeping, and may make your ally
        PC’s jealous of your time in the spotlight. But its power cannot be denied. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Master Manipulator</strong> – 
        The first ability is another fascinate, and the second ability doesn’t do too much. I think this is a pass. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Minor Shapeshift</strong> – 
A cool feat, but the bard can’t get into it with his spell list (there are no polymorph spells on the bard list except alter self, and you need a 4th level one). If you find some way around that, this is worth considering. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Nymph’s Kiss</strong> 
        (BoED p44)<strong></strong> – +2 against all charisma related effects (diplomacy, bluff, etc.), +1 bonus to all saves against spells and spell-like
        abilities, and 1 extra skill point per level. It’s a strong, passive feat. Obviously, take it at level 1 if you’re going to take it. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Trivial Knowledge</strong> 
        (RoS 145) – Gnome only. Roll knowledge and bardic knowledge checks twice, take the higher of the two rolls. This might be pretty good with knowledge
        devotion if you have the feat to spare (although, it’s hard to be a gnome and combat oriented). Otherwise, leave this. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Versatile Performer</strong> – 
        Use your highest rank perform for up to int-bonus other perform checks. I don’t see a ton of benefit to multiple performs. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Wanderer’s Diplomacy</strong> – 
        The first ability is a method to get the DM to do something he doesn’t want to do (never a good idea), the second ability can be solved with skill
        points via speak language, and the third ability lets you use bluff in place of diplomacy. All are pretty underpowered. 
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Familiar Feats</h4>
<p>
    If you’re going to pick up a familiar (a strong idea) you should read Dictum Mortuum’s excellent 
	<a href="http://community.wizards.com/forum/previous-editions-character-optimization/threads/1121616">Familiar’s Handbook</a>.
</p>
<ul>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Celestial Familiar</strong> 
        (BoED41) <strong></strong> – Quoting that handbook: “This isn't worth it a feat for a template. The magical beast type isn't going to
        benefit your familiar, except maybe from darkvision, but many already have it. Most familiars have 1-3 HD. So all your familiar gets is: Darkvision,
resistance to Acid, Cold, Electricity, smite evil. Which is worthless since animal have crappy charisma scores and familiars don't progress HD.”        
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Improved Familiar</strong> 
       – Improved familiar makes your familiar even more cool. There are a lot of really strong options here. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Obtain Familiar</strong> 
       – A familiar can be a really nice boost for a bard, especially something that can speak and activate items. There are handbooks on this topic if you’re
        interested in it. 
    </li>
    <li style="background-color: #ff0" >
        <strong>Planar Familiar</strong>
       – 
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Metamagic Feats</h4>
<ul>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Arcane Preparation</strong> 
        (PgtF 32) – Allows you to prepare spells ahead of time with metamagic applied to them, rather than doing so spontaneously (and having to cast at
        full-round speed). Rapid Metamagic is a better option, use that for this effect if you want it. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Coercive Spell</strong> 
        (DotU 47) – (+1 mod) Spells that deal damage also reduce targets will by 2 for 3 rounds. This would actually be pretty good, except that it requires
        the spell deal damage, which the bard doesn’t have a lot of. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Chain Spell</strong> 
(CArc 76)– (+3 Mod) There are a lot of bard spells that this applies to. Worth considering for your higher level feats.        
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Disguise Spell</strong> 
        (+1 mod) Hide the fact that you are casting spells for +1 spell level. There are ways to do this with Sleight of Hand (see that section) and Skill
        Tricks (see that section) so I think it’s better to pass on getting the feat; feats are valuable things. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Easy Metamagic</strong>
        (DRM 325) – This will let you persist 4<sup>th</sup> level spells. IF you’re going all-in on persist, this is something to look into, but otherwise
        probably a pass. <strong><u></u></strong>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Extend Spell</strong>
        (PHB)– (+1 mod) I think this is the best metamagic feat available to a bard. Many of the swift-cast spells can be really improved by
        doubling their duration (but you’ll need the Rapid Metamagic feat). 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Heighten Spell</strong>
(PHB)– (+1 mod) Spell DC is everything. The harder your spells are to resist in clinch moments, the more effective you are.        
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Metamagic School Focus</strong> 
        (CM) – Reduces the metamagic cost of a particular school of magic by 1. The main purpose in getting this is to let you persist a particular school of
        spells one level higher (so max 5 on persist spell if you go all-out here). <strong><u></u></strong>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Metamagic Song</strong> 
       – Lets you consume bardic musics (an overflowing resource) to reduce the metamagic cost of spells. There are two big limitations to this feat: 1. You
        cannot increase a spell’s level to higher than what you can cast (severely limiting the options with persist spell) and 2. You have to either reduce it
        entirely or not at all. Still strong. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Persistent Spell</strong> 
       – (+6 mod) Not worth considering unless you’re going into PrC Sublime Chord (9<sup>th</sup> level casting) or if you’re picking up the Talfirian Song
feat (which effectively increases your max spell level to 9). Even there, the benefits are a little limited, since, at best, you can extend 3        <sup>rd</sup> level spells. This is also very cheesy and might piss your DM off. That being said, here is a (hopefully complete) list of spells that
        are candidates for persisting. Obviously, due to your limited spell list and bardic musics per day, you’ll have to choose a few of these carefully.
        It’s also worth nothing that these spells are usually not the best choice for casting purposes, so you might want to substitute into them at later
        levels, instead of having them be dead weight all game. <strong><u></u></strong>

        <strong>Practical Metamagic</strong> 
        (RoD 101) - Another way to reduce the metamagic cost for persist. Probably not worth getting in any other build, but very good if you’re going the
        persist route. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Quicken Spell</strong> 
       – (+4 mod) Also very strong. The cost is high, but being able to cast as a swift action is amazing. Because you’re a spontaneous caster, you’ll also
        need Rapid Metamagic to get the benefit of this feat. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Rapid Metamagic</strong> 
       – If you’re going metamagic, this feat is very nice. Lets you apply metamagic without increasing the spell cast time. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Reach Spell</strong> 
       – The bard has a few OK touch spells. If you think you’re going to be using a lot of them, this is worth considering. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Sculpt Spell</strong> 
       – (+1 mod) One of the best metamagic feats, but, unfortunately, it does not have too much application in the bard’s spell list. If you focus on
        choosing spells that have area effects, you can get a lot out of this. You should note that the 10’ cubes should <em>probably</em> be read as being
        contiguous, which makes the effect worse than if you can put them anywhere. 
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Spell Improvement Feats</h4>
<ul>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Captivating Melody</strong> 
       – Consume a bardic music and pass a DC 15 + spell level check to increase the DC of an enchantment or illusion spell by 2. Pretty good. I like heighten
        spell / metamagic song better, but this is solid. 
    </li>
    <li style="background-color: #ff0" >
        <strong>Chaos Music</strong>  - 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Dragonsong</strong> 
       –+2 to DC to resist bardic music effects and +2 to perform checks involving song, poetry, or any other verbal performance. Pretty
        solid, but not amazing. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Enchanting Song</strong> 
       – Increase the DC of an enchantment spell by 1 by expending a bardic music. Requires spell focus (enchantment) which is pretty lame, and it’s not 100%
        clear that you can activate this multiple times for one spell. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Extraordinary Concentration</strong>
        (Cadv 109)<strong></strong> – Pass high DC concentration checks to concentrate as move or swift actions. If you fail, you lose the spell. This would be
        good, but it’s hard to make the risk of failure reasonably low enough, so I suggest passing on this (or getting it at level 18.)
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Extra Spell (CA)</strong> – 
Spend a feat to get another spell on your spell list. I don’t think this is a good use of a feat, but it’s not terrible.        
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Lingering Song</strong> 
       –Bardic music lasts 1 minute instead of 5 rounds after you stop performing. A harmonizing weapon can accomplish this, and melodic
        casting can effectively accomplish this (with some additional benefits). I think this is a pass. However, as Hiro Quester pointed out, this allows you
        to stack bardic musics on top of each other, which is nice.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Lyric Spell</strong> 
       – Lets you consume bardic musics to get more spells per day. More spells is good, and bardic musics can be an overflowing resource, especially if
        you’re not going the metamagic route.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Melodic Casting</strong> 
       –Two big benefits. 1: You can use perform instead of concentration for casting-related checks. 2: You can cast spells or activate
        magic items while maintaining bardic music. This is also an entry requirement for the very strong PrC Lyric Thaumaturge. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Misleading Song</strong>
        (ROS) – Spend bardic music to increase illusion caster level and DC by 1. Requires spell focus (illusion). I strongly recommend Metamagic Song and
        Heighten Spell instead. Same effect, much more versatile. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Mobile Spellcasting</strong> 
       –Move while casting as a standard action, letting you effectively move twice your normal distance in a turn. This can help you stay
        out of trouble. You risk losing the spell, though (a high concentration check), which is a big downside. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Talfirian Song</strong> 
        (RoF 170)– Requires Tethyrian human. Increase the DC of your illusion spells by expending bardic music slots. I prefer Heighten spell &amp; Metamagic
        Song (because it’s general case) but there are some distinct benefits to Talafrin Song: no cap on the amount you can dump into it, and it only requires
        one feat. There aren’t a ton of illusion spells that I recommend that have DCs, but a few important ones do. (Shadow conjuration and shadow evocation,
        for example). This also opens up a loophole with persist spell and metamagic song (see persist spell above). 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Versatile Spellcaster</strong> 
       –Use two level X spell slots to cast a level X+1 spell. Not bad. 
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Vow Feats</h4>
<p>
    The vows are a really strong option for a bard. That being said, they are campaign warping due to their restrictions and power level. If you go this route,
    you should make sure your DM and other PCs know what they’re getting into. It can be good if everyone’s prepared, but if not, these options will probably
    ruin your campaign.
</p>
<ul>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Sacred Vow</strong>
        (BoED p46) - +2 to Diplomacy checks. Not great, but an entry feat into the Vows. Given that it’s an entry feat, it’s not a bad effect.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Vow of Abstinence (BoED p 47)</strong>  - 
        +4 for saves against poison and drugs, but you can’t drink.Bad<strong>.</strong> 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Vow of Chastity (BoED p47)</strong>  - 
        +4 to will saves against charm and phantasm effects, but you can’t get laid.The effect is limited and not great. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Vow of Nonviolence (BoED p47)</strong> – 
        This is interesting for a caster bard. +4 to all spell and ability DCs, but you can’t do any damage or kill anyone else. It still allows you to do area
        effects, debuffs, and buffs. Requires a specific build, but can be strong. Requires Sacred Vow, which isn’t a great feat. Because of that, I prefer
        Metamagic Song and Heighten Spell, but this is interesting too. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Vow of Peace (BoED p48)</strong> – 
        This would probably pair up with vow of non-violence. +6 to AC, +4 to diplomacy, a permanent aura of calm emotion, weapons that hit you can shatter
        against your skin, if you have vow of poverty, you get an additional +6 to AC. All in return for additional restrictions about killing things. Very
        strong.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Vow of Poverty (BoED p48)</strong>
       – Take magical item progression out of your DMs hands. This is nothing special for a bard. 
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Bardic Music Feats</h4>
<ul>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Arcane Accompaniment (PHB II)</strong> – 
        Expend a spell slot to extend the duration of bardic musics. Not worth a feat at all. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Arcane Flourish</strong> 
        (PHB II) –Swift action to give up a spell slot to increase a perform check. Not great. Your spells are typically better than a small
        bonus to perform (and many spells can give you that, if you want it.) Not worth spending a feat on this. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Chant of Fortitude</strong> – 
        Use bardic music to keep allies conscious when they’re at negative hit points. Kinda cool, but not worth a feat. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Chant of the Long Road (CS 74)</strong>
       – Spend a bardic music feat to offset the non-lethal damage from hustling for 1 hour. Y U C K.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Chord Of Distraction</strong> 
– Immediate action is nice, and the ability can help out your rogue party members. The cost of three bardic musics is really high, though.        
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Doom Speak (CoR 21)</strong> 
       –This feat is OK. Due to the intimidate 8 requirement, a bard can’t gain access until level 13 unless he picks up intimidate as a
class skill somehow. The DC to resist is very high, and it can help you lower the defenses of a big bad guy for the rest of the party.        
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Epic of the Lost King</strong> 
       – I love that you can activate this as a move action. I don’t like that the effect is so limited. Pass. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Extra Music</strong> 
        (Cadv 109)– Bardic music is a pretty abundant resource, but if you prestige out and are doing metamagic reduction, this may be worth
        taking. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Green Ear (CAdv)</strong> – 
        Affect plants with bardic music. This seems really weak unless the campaign setting is especially plant-heavy.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Haunting Melody</strong> 
       –See the alternate class features section<strong>.</strong>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Ice Harmonics</strong> 
        (Frost 48) – Cause nearby ice to explode, dealing 2d6 + CHA_MOD damage in area around the exploding square. Damage is weak, and range of application is
        tiny. Pass. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Inspire Spellpower (RoS)</strong> – 
        Spend a bardic music to increase ally’s caster level by 1. Not great at all. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Ironskin Chant</strong> 
       – At the level you get access to this, the damage reduction just isn’t worth that much. There are better uses for a feat. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Melodic Casting</strong>
        (CM 44)<strong></strong> – A solid feat. Lets you avoid putting skill points into concentration and lets you cast spells and activate most magical
        items (by command word or spell completion) while maintaining bardic music. It’s an entry feat into Lyric Thaumaturge. As far as entry feats go, this
        is a pretty painless one. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Music of the Outer Planes (LoM)</strong> 
        - Use bardic music to sicken, vitalize, or lull aberrations. If you have a lot of these in your campaign, this might be worth looking at. In a standard
        campaign, it will be too narrow. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Requiem</strong> – 
        Use bardic music to affect undead creatures as well (although they only last half the duration). Not generally good, but there may be campaigns where
        this is valuable. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Song of the Heart</strong> 
       –See the alternate class features section<strong>.</strong>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Sound of Silence</strong> 
       –Two bardic musics is a little expensive, it requires a standard action, and the effect isn’t amazing. Pass. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Subsonics</strong> 
       – Lets you activate bardic musics without anyone knowing. It’s cool, but not amazing. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Undertone of Heresy</strong> 
       – Increase the DC of your bardic music effects by 2 by spending an additional bardic music. Not bad, especially for the half-elf bard who has more
        applications. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Warning Shout</strong> 
       – Not bad. Can give an ally +5 to reflex and evasion, as an immediate action, for two bardic musics. A little narrow, but solid. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-a">
        <strong>Words of Creation</strong> 
        (BoED) – Doubles the bonus on inspire courage. Absurdly strong compared to other feat options. And it has some other mild benefits. 
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Combat</h4>
<ul>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Arcane strike</strong>
       – Not bad for a melee bard. We have limited spell slots, which makes it less appealing, but it is a nice way to power a lot of force into one standard
        action.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Battledancer</strong> 
       – A really limited and constricting +2 Morale bonus to attack. This doesn’t stack with bardic music, so it’s complete garbage. Even if it did stack, it
        would still be pretty bad. Pass. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Combat Panache</strong> 
       – This is hard to get into because it requires intimidate 8. Otherwise, the three abilities are all pretty good. Nothing amazing, but cool and solid.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Draconic Aura</strong> 
       – If you have the dragonblood subtype, this ability scales with level, which makes it good. It gives you a single aura you can activate as a swift
        action which pumps your teammates, or debuffs your allies. Not bad. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Dragonfire Inspiration</strong> 
       – You need the dragonblood subtype. This effectively gets somewhere between an additional 0.5 to 1 point of damage per attack for everyone affected by
        your inspire courage. (Teammates get +Xd6 damage instead of +X to attack and damage). If your DM will allow this to stack with inspire courage, it’s
        bonkers good. If not, then it’s OK. Probably worth one feat in some builds, but not worth two (there’s a feat that will give you the dragonblood
        subtype). See my long section on the math and rules on this feat below for more information.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Improved Disarm / Improved Trip</strong> – 
        Trip and Disarm are both solid effects, but I don’t think the improved feats are worth going into unless you’re restricted to core books.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-a">
        <strong>Knowledge Devotion</strong> 
       – Amazing for a combat bard. Get big boosts to attack and damage by using knowledges.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Point Blank Shot</strong> 
       – A feat tax. It’s bad, but you need it to get into all the archery builds. (Unless you talk your DM into being nice to you). 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Power Attack</strong> 
        - A solid feat, especially in a class that has a lot of ways to get a higher attack bonus. The math on optimizing this each round can be fun to figure
        out. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Precise Shot</strong> 
       – Effectively +4 to ranged attacks most of the time. Not bad for an archery Bard.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Snowflake Wardance</strong> 
       – Gain a charisma bonus to attacks, be fatigued afterwards. Pretty solid. Not as good as knowledge devotion, but you could definitely take both if
        you’re focused on melee. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>White Raven Tactics</strong> 
       – If you can get access to a white raven stance, this is great. You get to turn on inspire courage as a swift action.If you’re a combat oriented bard, dipping into warblade or crusader for this might be worth looking into. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Two Weapon Fighting / Improved Two Weapon Fighting</strong> – 
        This could be good on a melee bard, especially combined with snowflake wardance.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Multiclass Specific Feats</h4>
<ul>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Devoted Performer</strong> – 
        Allow free multiclassing between Bard and Paladin, and stacks the levels for calculating smite evil and bardic musics. Not bad if you’re going into the
        Divine Prankster prestige class, but not amazing. 
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Spells</h3>
<p>
    Spells are one of the bard’s strongest class features. However, a bard doesn’t get to know nearly as many as a sorcerer, so it’s important to make sure the
    spells you choose have a wide range of cases where they can be used. Breadth of applicability is key.
</p>
<p>
    There are a lot of spells that are on the Bard’s list which are strong, but aren’t worth spending a precious “Spell Known” slot on, because use of the
    spell doesn’t come up enough. <strong>Scrolls and wands are a great option for these spells.</strong> 
</p>
<h4>Level 0</h4>
<ul>
    <li class="rank-a">
        <strong>Detect Magic</strong> 
       – Also incredibly strong. Has a lot of uses. Definitely a must-have.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Dancing Lights</strong> – 
        A lot like ghost sounds. The better your imagination, the better this spell gets. It is a little eclipsed by Silent Image, but that’s OK. I still
        recommend getting it. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Ghost Sounds</strong> – 
        Very solid, but requires some creativity to get maximum value. Spells like this make playing a caster fun. Use your imagination. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Know Direction</strong>
       – Buy a compass. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Light</strong>
       – Buy a torch (or sunrod for style).
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Lullaby</strong> – 
        Almost identical in results to fascinate. Not worth doubling this limited effect, in my opinion. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Mage Hand</strong> – 
        This is my 6<sup>th</sup> spell slot. I like it, but it’s a little limited.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Mending</strong> – 
        Not bad, but not many applications in-game. It’s a shame, because in real-life, this would be a great spell to have, but in D&amp;D world, it just
        doesn’t do too much. There are some roleplaying opportunities here, but it takes work to get to them. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Minor Disguise</strong>
       – You can do so much more with a spell, even a cantrip, than this. Pass. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-a">
        <strong>Prestidigitation</strong> 
       – This is a mini-wish. There are so many things you can do with this. It is the cantrip I cast the most, by far. (see Tome &amp; Blood page 80 for some
        ideas)
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Read Magic</strong> 
       – If you want to be able to use scrolls, you need this. If not, you can pass.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Resistance</strong> – 
        The 1 minute duration on this makes it unusable. Maybe as part of a persist spell strategy? 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Seeker’s Chant</strong> – 
        Get +2 to search (but minuses to move silent). Not bad, I’d pass though. Leave searching to the rogue. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Songbird</strong> – 
        Get a +1 to any charisma based check against anyone who saw a performance. Not bad, but a little limited for a spell slot, for me.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Summon Instrument</strong> – 
        This can be good for bards who use instruments, or as an improvised bashing weapon. The short duration makes it a little sad, though. 
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Level 1</h4>
<ul>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Ambient Song</strong>
        (SaS 89) – Make bardic music sound like ambient noise, to avoid detection. Not great, but maybe a cool persist target. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Charm Person (PHB)</strong> – 
        I love the flavor of this ability, but the limitation to humanoid is a little sad. If you like this, I recommend you take Charm Monster instead, which
        can target any creature type. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Cheat (SC)</strong> – 
        Roll twice in a game of chance that’s not magical. Really cool flavor wise, but insane to put one of your spells known into this.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Combined Talent</strong> – 
        Give an ally a boost to a skill, matching the level of another ally. When do you need this? Yuck. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Cure Light Wounds (PHB)</strong> 
       – Just get a wand of cure light wounds. It’s great that this is on the bard’s spell list (because we can activate the wand easily),
        but there’s no reason to take it as a spell known. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Disguise Self (PHB)</strong> – 
        Limited application which can be achieved with a skill. Pass. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Distort Speech</strong> 
        (CAdv) <strong></strong> – Target gets a fort save (which is good vs. spellcasters), and the spellcaster gets a 50% chance of spell failure. Not bad,
        but most of the time I think you’ll have better things to do with a standard action, and you’re not always up against spell casters. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Expeditious Retreat (PHB)</strong> – 
        Worse than the swift one, and very hard to justify as one of our few spells known. This is a good persist spell target, if you’re going that route, but
        I’d recommend getting the swift variation instead. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Expeditious Retreat, Swift</strong> – 
        This being a swift cast is really nice. I’d prefer swift invisibility, though. It accomplishes a lot of the same goals, and has a lot more upsides.
        This is a good persist spell target, if you’re going that route. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Feather Fall (PHB)</strong> – 
        This spell is really nice to have in your back pocket, but not as one of the few spells you get. I recommend getting this on a ring or item if you like
        the effect. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Friendly Face</strong> – 
Grants +5 to diplomacy or gather information. If you like this, take improvisation instead. A lot more dynamic and is stronger after level 10.        
    </li>
    <li class="rank-a">
        <strong>Grease</strong> – 
        Very powerful effect that targets reflex saves and balance. Not many bard spells target reflex, and I think it’s nice to have at least 1 or 2 in your
        list that target each of the saves, so you can choose the right spell for the right enemy. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Harmony (PGtF)</strong> – 
        Standard action cast that gives the next inspire courage +2. I recommend inspirational boost instead. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Hideous Laughter</strong> – 
        A pretty strong effect for a level 1 spell, but it comes with a lot of limitations (close range, can’t affect creatures with low intelligence, most
enemies get a +4 on their save). It also only targets 1 creature, where a save completely negates the effect. Not bad, but not in love.        
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Improvisation</strong> – 
        (Note: Complete Adventurer has this a 5<sup>th</sup> level spell, but spell compendium has it as 1<sup>st</sup> level) – This spell is cool. The two
        big downsides are that it only lasts 1 round / level, and that you can only use one-quarter of the luck pool per activation. At level 6, that means
        this gives a +3 to a skill, an attack, or whatever. For combat, it’s underwhelming because it takes a standard action to turn on. For out-of-combat
        situations, it’d good if you have a few skill tricks in a row that you need to pass, and you have a round to spend preparing. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Inspirational Boost</strong> – 
        Gain an additional +1 to Inspire Courage. Very strong damage output for a level 1 spell, assuming you have a party that uses attacks. This gets better
        the more allies you have that use combat. Despite its strength, I usually pass on this spell. I’d like to have something a bit more dynamic. That’s a
        roleplaying choice, though.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Instant Diversion (RotD)</strong> – 
        A swift cast mirror image thatonly lasts 1 round. 1 image per 4 levels of your caster level. It’s OK, but the low duration makes it a
        little weak. A good candidate for extend spell. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Invisibility, Swift</strong> 
        - Being able to cast this as a swift action is great. It can get you out of combat, buy you some time, or set you up for a strong attack. In addition,
        it’s a level 1 spell, not level 2 like normal invisibility. The big downside is the one-round duration and that you can only target yourself with it.
        Despite those limitations, it’s still a very strong spell. It’s a great target for extend spell &amp; metamagic song. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Ironthunder Horn</strong> – 
An OK spell that targets reflex (which is a rare thing for Bards), but it overlaps with grease pretty hard. I recommend grease instead of this.        
    </li>
    <li class="rank-a">
        <strong>Silent Image</strong> – 
        This spell can do so much. You need to use your imagination, but the options are endless. The best part is that spells like this never get tired. You
        can always find new and clever uses, and your party will never get tired of the cool tricks you come up with. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Sleep</strong>  - 
        Save or be-taken-prisoner, potentially against multiple foes. This is really strong at levels 2 through 3, and OK at levels 4-5, but after that, it’s
        pretty weak. You can take it if you like it. but make sure you swap it out at level 8.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Summon Monster I (PHB)</strong> – 
        Not bad for finding and disabling traps. Otherwise not much to do with this; the combat abilities are pretty weak. I’d pass. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Unseen Servant (PHB)</strong> – 
        Not bad in general, but a very bad use of a bard’s limited spells known. Pass. 
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Level 2</h4>
<ul>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Animate Instrument</strong> – 
        Animate an instrument, so it continues your performance for you. This lets you stack bardic music effects continuously (like inspire courage and
        inspire greatness). Not a bad effect, but I don’t love spending a spell-known or a spell-slot for it. This would be great as something you enchant
        directly onto an instrument. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-a">
        <strong>Alter Self</strong> – 
        One of the best spells in the game. The options are limitless, and there are threads and threads devoted to this spell. Your DM should ban it. If he
        doesn’t, it’s extremely powerful. The pathfinder one is more reasonable, but not nearly as powerful. <strong><u></u></strong>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Battle Hymn</strong> 
        (SC 25)<strong></strong> – Allow all allies to reroll will saves, after knowing result, before knowing whether it passed or failed. Not great, but a
        good persist target. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Bladeweave (SC 31)</strong> – 
        Swift cast, lasts 1 rd / level, and dazes creatures hit by your melee attack. Pretty cool for a melee bard. <strong><u></u></strong>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Blur</strong> – 
        Attacks miss you 20% of the time. Maybe worth considering for a melee bard. <strong><u></u></strong>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Calm Emotions</strong> – 
        A cool spell, but the low duration makes it hard to make a big impact with this. <strong><u></u></strong>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Cloud of Bewilderment</strong> – 
        A cloud effect that makes its inhabitants sickened (can’t take standard actions). It targets fort, which is great. A good bit worse than glitterdust,
        though, and similar in effect and application. <strong><u></u></strong>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Cure Moderate Wounds</strong> – 
I really like to avoid healing on a bard. If you’re going to get a heal spell, the 3<sup>rd</sup> level one is probably the best choice.        <strong><u></u></strong>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Darkness (PHB 216)</strong> – 
        A good spell, but it has limited application. Might be cool with a melee bard with blindfighting. <strong><u></u></strong>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Delusions of Grandeur</strong> – 
        A save-or-be-bad spell. There are good save-or-die spells at level 1. Not worth taking this at level 2. <strong><u></u></strong>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Detect Thoughts</strong> – 
        This spell is very strong. <strong><u></u></strong>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Dimension Leap</strong> – 
        Teleport10’ per 2 caster levels. I love this. Gets you out of a lot of trouble. <strong><u></u></strong>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Disquietude (MoF p90)</strong> – 
        Only good vs. melee enemies and there are lots of ways around it. It’s a conditional save-or-be-bad spell. If you’re going that route, at least
        save-or-die. <strong><u></u></strong>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Elation (BoED p98)</strong> – 
        Allies in an 80’ radius spread get +2 Str, +2 Dex, +5 speed. Even though the bonuses are morale bonuses, they stack with Inspire Courage because they
        don’t directly affect attack / damage. Not a bad buff for level 2, but I think there are better options. This is a good persist spell target, if you’re
        going that route. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Enthrall</strong> – 
        A slightly better fascinate. Bad use of a spell slot. <strong><u></u></strong>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Entice Gift</strong> 
        (BoVD p93)–Target must pass a will save or give you what he’s holding. This has so many fun applications.<u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Fly, Swift</strong> – 
        Fly for one round? Very strong. <strong><u></u></strong>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>
            Grace – Swift casting, get 60’ illumination on your body, +2 to dex, +10 to move, and your touch and melee attacks are good (for overcoming DR).
            Not great. <u></u>
       </strong> 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-a">
        <strong>Glitterdust</strong> – 
        Arguably the best 2<sup>nd</sup> level spell in the game. I’d recommend to any DM that they use the pathfinder version instead (bad guys get a save
        every round) and even that is solid. <strong><u></u></strong>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Harmonize</strong> 
        (RoS 162)<strong></strong> – Activate bardic musics as a move action instead of standard. Not really worth it because of low duration, but a great
        target for persist.<u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Insidious Insight</strong> 
        (RoE p187)<strong></strong> – +10 bonus to the social skills against one target, lasts 24 hours, but he gets a will save. Worth considering if you’re a
        face bard.The will save is sad, and I think suggestion ends up being a stronger choice. <strong><u></u></strong>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Invisibility</strong> – 
Very strong. I recommend taking either this or swift invisibility (or both). If you take this, swap it out when greater invisibility becomes available.        <strong><u></u></strong>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Know Vulnerabilities</strong> – 
        I prefer the skill trick for this effect. We can’t afford to do something with spells when skills can get the job done.<strong> <u></u></strong>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Mirror Image</strong> – 
        Not a terrible spell, but weak. The standard casting time really sets this one back. <strong><u></u></strong>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Pyrotechnics</strong> – 
This spell is really cool and dynamic, but a little limited. If your DM bans Glitterdust, this may be worth taking<strong><u>.</u></strong>        <strong><u></u></strong>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Silence (PHB)</strong> – 
Can be good vs other casters or bards, and also helps the rogue sneak around. Not a bad spell by any means, but nothing to write home about either.        <strong><u></u></strong>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Sonic Weapon</strong> – 
        Standard action to make a weapon deal an extra 1d6 damage. Not at all good, but it makes a good persist target, if you’re going that route. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Sonorous Hum</strong>
       – Maintain concentration onthe next spell you cast that requires concentration without consuming your standard action. I don’t think
        this is worth getting as a spell; the bard doesn’t have enough spells per day or enough spells that require concentration. <strong><u></u></strong>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Suggestion</strong> – 
        This is very strong, has a lot of roleplaying opportunities, and fits right in the character mold of a typical bard. The only downside is that it
        overlaps with your class feature. <strong><u></u></strong>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Summon Monster II</strong> – 
This isn’t a very strong level for Summon Monster. III and V are the best for combat, and I is the best for sacrificial lambs. Pass on this.        <strong> <u></u></strong>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Whirling Blade</strong> – 
        Attack creatures in a line with your standard weapon. A little hard to get use out of, but can be OK. I’d probably pass, but weapon-focused bards might
        like this for flavor. <strong><u></u></strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Level 3</h4>
<ul>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Alter Fortune</strong>
       – I would love this spell if not for the XP cost. It’s just not worth having on our limited list of spells with that big downside. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Charm Monster</strong> – 
        I am biased towards this spell. A will save completely negates this effect. On the other hand, if you succeed, you get a best buddy for days. I think
        of Raistlin charming that gully dwarf, and can’t help myself. It’s not mechanically the strongest, but I really enjoy this one. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Clairaudience / Clairvoyance</strong> – 
Takes a long time to cast is the big downside. I think this is a perfect spell for a scroll. You won’t need it every day, but when you do, it’s clutch.        <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Confusion</strong> – 
        Pros: It hits in a 15’ burst. Cons: The targets get a will save. If they fail, there’s still a ~35% chance they’ll do something you don’t like. The
        odds of failure are too high for me to endorse. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Cure Serious Wounds</strong> – 
        I just don’t like taking healing spells as a bard. If you must, this one is probably better than the other options. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Curse of the Putrid Husk</strong> – 
        A sleep-like spell that targets a single opponent (will).Not a bad spell, but not the best. Good characters may want to ask their DM
        to allow this to be re-fluffed as a good spell. (The creature collapses under the weight of realization of its sins?)<u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Deep Slumber/Greater Sleep</strong> – 
        These are both a better version of sleep, but you get access to them at level 7. This spell loses its strength around level 9 or 10, and you won’t be
        able to swap it out until level 13 (or 11 if you go into sublime chord). Not a great option, IMO. I like deep slumber a little better than greater
        sleep. Deep slumber affects 10HD worth of creature, greater sleep affects 4d6 HD. The average is the same, but I’d rather not have variance in this
        effect; it makes it difficult to plan. If you want a sleep effects, Curse of the Putrid Husk is probably your best bet. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Dispel Magic</strong> – 
        A good, general purpose effect. Can solve a lot of problems. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Displacement</strong> – 
        Succeed on a touch attack to make target miss 50% of attacks. Get close to the big scary smasher guy to _maybe_ have him not be able to hit you? Just
        stay away from him!<u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Fear</strong> – 
        Will save or be panicked/cowered (two good ones). If the save succeeds, the bad guy is still shaken for a round. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Gaseous Form</strong> – 
        A pretty cool spell that can frustrate DMs and get you out of trouble, but I think it has limited application. I’d like to have this on a scroll rather
        than in my spell list. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>G’elsewhere Chant</strong> – 
        Teleport subject randomly. I like that it can hit bad guys. I don’t like that it’s random. Gives the DM too much power to screw you over. “A prison
        cell is perfectly safe!”<u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-a">
        <strong>Glibness</strong> – 
        Nearly campaign smashing. Convince anyone of anything. A cool spell, but it can completely over-shadow all social skills. I recommend using this
        sparingly if you get it, so your DM and other players don’t kill you. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Haste</strong> 
        (PHB p239)<strong></strong> – Make your whole party better in combat. A really good effect for buffer bards.<u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Insignia of Healing</strong> – 
        1d8 + LVL healing to everyone carrying a special insignia that costs gold to create. I don’t like healing spells, and this one isn’t very strong at
        all; mass low-amounts of healing is rarely as effective as targeted high-amounts. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Invisibility Sphere</strong> – 
I’m not in love with this spell. It basically lets your party sneak by some guards, assuming they can keep quiet and there’s enough room to walk.        <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Leomund’s Tiny Hut</strong> – 
        This is a cool idea for archer bards. It is a concealment--on-order spell that you can see out of and shoot from. Pretty cool. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Listening Coin</strong> – 
        Turn two coins into a one-way walkie-talkie that lasts 1 hour / level. A pretty good Clairvoyance substitution spell. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Phantom Steed</strong> – 
        This is a strong spell that eventually lets you fly all over the world on your own personal airship. My big problem with it is that it’s primarily
        about mobility and that your teammates don’t get one. Definitely strong (but make sure you have featherfall handy!)<u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Scrying</strong> – 
        This is a really strong spell. Lets you get a lot of information ahead of time. It may be better to get this on a scroll and use it sparingly, so as
        not to piss off your DM and other players. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Sculpt Sound</strong> – 
This is very solid. It’s a save-or-be-nearly-useless vs multiple casters. It also has some ancillary roleplaying applications. Worth considering.        <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Slow</strong> – 
        The inverse of haste. Make the bad guys really slow. The fact that it gets a will save makes it a bit worse than haste, but still very strong. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Summon Monster III</strong> – 
        Probably the best Summon Monster out there. The Bison or the Fiend are the two best options. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Vision of Fear</strong> – 
        Doesn’t do anything except give your DM a hook to continue the story. Pass. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Warcry</strong> – 
        A lot like fear, except it targets fortitude. A failed save cowers for 1d4 rounds, but the spell has no effect if the creature saves. The effect is a
        little weaker, but I like that it targets fort. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Winding Alleys</strong> – 
        A maze-like spell, that has some limitations. If you are spending most of your campaign in a city, this could be strong. Otherwise, I don’t like the
        conditions on it. <u></u>
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Level 4</h4>
<ul>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Blinding Beauty</strong> – 
        A 4th level glitterdust-like-spell that targets fort. Any creature that looks at you and fails the save is permanently blind. If you’re
        going to take this, make sure you sit down with the rest of your party and setup some safe words, otherwise they’ll be mighty mad at you. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-a">
        <strong>Celerity</strong> – 
        Acting now is so much better than acting later. This spell is very, very strong. <strong>Greater</strong> <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Dimension Door</strong> – 
        Local teleport for the entire party. Very strong. Can be annoying for DMs not prepared for this. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Dominate Person</strong> – 
        This feels like the sort of spell you’d like to have on a scroll, if you can figure out how to read the scroll without alarming your target. You can
        control a king with this for extended periods of time. It’s not bad as a daily spell, since it lets you take full control of a bad guy for an extended
        period of time. The big downside is it only targets humanoids. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Freedom of Movement</strong> – 
        This spell can get you out of a lot of sticky situations. The more aggressive your DM, the better this gets. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Hold Monster</strong> – 
        Another save or die that targets will. You have better options at lower levels if you want this kind of effect. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Mirror Image</strong> – 
        This is much better than the original! Cast as an immediate action, make yourself very hard to hit, and the images regenerate. Not bad. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Insidious Suggestion</strong> – 
        For spontaneous casters, this isn’t much better than regular suggestion. It’s a shame, because we’d love that +2 bonus to social skills while it was
        prepared, but it’s not worth being 2 levels higher for that. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Invisibility, Greater</strong> – 
        This spell is amazing. You can attack while invisible! For a melee bard it’s incredible. For a buffer bard it’s great. I love this one. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Legend Lore</strong> – 
        This just gives your DM a hook to dump in story arc information. Let him do that without burning up your abilities. It’s not a bad spell, just bad as a
        Known Spell. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Modify Memory</strong> – 
        This spell has a lot of really powerful out-of-combat possibilities. I like it a lot. It’s one you have to use your imagination for. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Rainbow Pattern</strong> – 
        Nullify up to 24HD worth of creatures. Very strong. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Resistance, Greater</strong> – 
        +3 to all saves that lasts 24 hours. The big problem with this spell is that it doesn’t stack with the ubiquitous cloak of resistance.<u> </u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Ruin Delver’s Fortune</strong> – 
        I love this spell. Get bonuses to the save you need (or extra HPs) immediately. It’s purely defensive, but it’s very good at the job. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-a">
        <strong>Shadow Conjuration</strong> – 
        The biggest limit on a bard’s spellcasting is Spells Known. This blows that metric wide open, giving you access to a bunch of spells from the best
        school of magic. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Summon Monster IV</strong> – 
        At most, I think a bard wants two summoning spells, and probably just one, that gets upgraded over time. Given that, you can probably skip IV, and use
        III and V instead. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Unluck</strong> – 
        Save-or-suck.Target has to take the worst of two rolls every time they roll. The effect is very strong, but it targets will
        (something we do a lot), only targets one bad guy, and doesn’t automatically win. I pass on this, but it is a strong spell. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Voice of the Dragon</strong> – 
        Pros: +10 to social skills, and culminates in a suggestion spell. Cons: Why do you need social skills if you’re about to cast suggestion? Only lasts 10
        min / level. <u></u>
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Level 5</h4>
<ul>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Blink, Improved / Greater</strong> – 
        Go back and forth between ethereal and solid at will.Physical attacks have a 100% miss chance, you can walk through some solid
        objects, and never miss if you attack. This is strong. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Body Harmonic</strong> – 
        Deal 1d10 points of damage to a single ability score each round, lasting up to 1 round per level (requires concentration), will negates. You can only
        target a single ability score once every five rounds. This can be good against creatures you know have a very low single stat. For example, this can
        drop a T-Rex if you target intelligence. That being said, for a level 5 spell, it’s not a great effect. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Cure Light Wounds, Mass</strong> – 
        Yuck. A mild heal on every party member usually isn’t what you need.<u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Dispel Magic, Greater</strong> – 
        This is an improved version of dispel magic. It’s also very strong. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Friend to Foe</strong> – 
        All creatures (max one / CL) you want to target in a 15’ radius get a will save or attack each other. Two big downsides: A will save, and after one
        successful attack, the spell ends for that attacker. If you can hit enough bad guys, you can get a lot of value out of one standard action. (Think of
        how many standard actions you can potentially steal from the opposing team if you can target 3-5 bad guys). <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Glimpse of Eternity</strong> 
        (MoE p96)<strong></strong> – Target takes 1d6 dmg per caster level (max 15d6) and is confused (the one where it does random stuff) for 1 round / 3
        levels. Will halves damage and negates confusion. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Mislead</strong> 
– Not in love with this spell.Swift invisibility and silent image can accomplish almost exactly the same thing at a much lower cost.        <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Otto’s Resistable Dance</strong> – 
        The imagery is funny, and it’s nice that it hits one living creature per level, but the effect (-2 to AC, -2 to Will, -2 to Concentration, -2 to
        spellcraft) is such a weak debuff that I can’t see this being worth casting. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Song of Discord</strong> – 
        Pros: 20’ radius spread, opponents fight each other sometimes. Cons: they first get a will save, then there’s only a 50% chance it works. It hits your
        teammates as well as your enemies. Not great, but not the worst. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Scry Location</strong> – 
        If you like scry spells, this is a solid one. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-a">
        <strong>Shadow Evocation</strong> – 
        Just like Shadow Conjuration, this really opens up the bard’s spells known. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Shadow Walk</strong> – 
        The closest thing a bard gets to a teleport spell. If you take an unwilling subject, you can bring him into the shadow plane and then dump him there,
        which is pretty cool. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Suggestion, Mass</strong> – 
        Suggestion on a number of creatures equal to your caster level. Sweet!<u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Summon Monster V</strong> – 
        A fine spell. If you like summoning, the 5<sup>th</sup> level of this spell has some cool options. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-a">
        <strong>Unfettered Heroism</strong>
(RoE p 190)<strong></strong> – Immediate cast,get a bonus action point each turn, lasts 1 round per level (<a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/variant/adventuring/actionPoints.htm">d20srd link</a>). The spell
        requires that you have at least one action point available, so if your campaign doesn’t use action points, you might be out of luck here. Otherwise
        this is really strong (Lets you cast lower level spells over and over and over and over again, for example.)<u></u>
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Level 6</h4>
<ul>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Charm Monster, Mass</strong> – 
        The max HD affected is twice your caster level, which is a real limitation. Mass Charm really means “Charm 2-5 monsters”. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Dirge</strong> – 
        All enemies in a 50’ burst around the bard take 2 points of strength and dex damage every round. Lasts 1 round / level. Fort negates, but the bad guy
        had to roll each round. Activate once, get the effect once each turn. I like this. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Eyebite</strong> – 
        Good against weak opponents, bad against strong opponents. I hate that. The spell language isn’t clear, but I’m pretty sure it consume your standard
        action each turn. If that’s the case, it’s terrible. If you get to activate each additional round without consuming additional standard actions, then
        it’s not so bad. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-a">
        <strong>Gaes / Quest</strong> – 
        No saving throw! The target must fulfill a mission of your choice (or spend 1 day / level fulfilling an open-ended mission). This is open ended, highly
        subject to DM rule, and can reward creative play. A really cool spell, but also dangerous to your campaign. Use at your own risk!<u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Glimpse of the Prophecy</strong> 
        (MoE p96)<strong></strong> – Get a +1 to AC and to saves while in effect, and it lasts 1 hour per level. Then you can discharge it as an immediate
        action to get +10 to a save. A solid defensive spell. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Greater Scrying</strong> 
       – Solid spell. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Heaven’s Trumpet (</strong>
        BoED 101)<strong></strong> – This spell is solid, but requires that you have the archon sub-type, which is a huge limitation.Enemies
        must pass a fort save or be paralyzed for 1d4 rounds. A huge area: 120’. This one is a solid spell, and I like that it targets fort. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Hindsight</strong> – 
        Lets you look into the past of the place you’re standing. Really cool flavor, but a little hard to get a ton of use out of. If you can make it to your
        arch-enemies evil lair, you can learn all of his dirty secrets, of course. This is another spell which just gives the DM a hook to tell his story. I
        don’t mind doing that, but not at the cost of one of our precious spell slots. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Otto’s Irresistible Dance</strong> – 
        The title of this spell is misleading; it requires a touch attack to come into effect. Not bad, but not amazing. Good on a melee bard. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Nixie’s Grace</strong> – 
        What’s interesting about this spell is the +8 to charisma. That effectively gives you about 6 more bonus spells-per-day of lower levels that you can
        use temporarily (more if you’re in the sublime chord prestige class). In addition, you get swim speed, underwater breathing, low light vision, damage
        reduction 5 / cold iron, +6 to Dex, and +2 to Wisdom. An interesting spell. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Permanent Image</strong> – 
        I can’t think of a great use for this spell for PCs. As a DM I use it a lot. As a player, it’s rare that you’ll need this. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-a">
        <strong>Project Image</strong> – 
        This is really strong image spell. It grants sight, hearing, doesn’t get destroyed by damage, and distracts your enemies. Very strong. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>Protege</strong> – 
        Grant a party member the powers of a bard of approximately half your strength. I can’t think of why you would do this. Crappy duration, too. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Resistance, Superior</strong> – 
        +6 to all saves for 24 hours. Cast this before going to sleep, wake up with a nice shield and full spell slots. This is a great target for chain spell
        (if you’ve gone into sublime chord) at higher levels. The big problem with this spell is that it doesn’t stack with the ubiquitous cloak of resistance.
        If you have a good alternate use for that body slot, this might be worth looking into. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>Shout, Greater</strong> – 
        Hits on multiple fronts: 10d6 damage (half with fort save); stunned for 1 round (negated with fort save); deafened for 4d6 rounds (half duration with
        fort save). The best part of deafened is casters gets a 20% spell failure.<u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Summon Monster VI</strong> – 
        One of the weaker summon monster spells. Probably pass on this one. <u></u>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>Veil</strong> 
       – Disguise on the whole party. At this high level, I have a hard time seeing a use for it that won’t get seen through. <u></u>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Notes on Dragonfire Inspiration</h3>
<h4>How much damage is Dragonfire Inspiration worth?</h4>
<p>
As a rouge estimate, on average, Dragonfire inspiration tends to be worth about 0.5 to 1 damage, per attack, per level of inspire courage.    <strong>However, sometimes it nets less damage than inspire courage</strong>. The math behind this question is complex and depends on five factors:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>The AC of the Bad Guy</strong>
       – The higher the AC of the bad guy, the worse dragonfire inspiration becomes.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Your attack bonus</strong>  - 
        The higher your attack bonus, the better dragonfire inspiration becomes.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Your average damage</strong>
       – The higher your average damage, the worse dragonfire inspration becomes.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Your Inspire Courage Modifier</strong> 
       – This tends to just be a multiplier, but it seems to be some sort of bell curve in certain situations (see below)
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>The Damage Reduction of the Bad Guy</strong>
        - The more damage reduction the bad guy has, the better dragonfire inspiration becomes.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    While dragonfire inspiration does tend to net more damage, here are some exceptions and things to think about:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Sometimes dragonfire inspiration nets <strong>less damage</strong> than inspire courage.
    </li>
	<li>
	Dragonfire inspiration is stronger vs. opponents with lower AC and weaker vs opponents with higher AC.
    </li>
	<li>
	If your damage is already very high compared to your attack bonus, dragonfire inspiration is worse. (This means dragonfire inspiration and power attack
    have some anti-synergy).
    </li>
	<li>
	Oftentimes, just connecting is more important than getting one extra hit point of damage. Rarely does the bad guy hangs on by one HP after getting it.
    Usually, he just needs one successful strike to put him down. This works as an argument in favor of inspire courage.
    </li>
	<li>
	Similarly, I think damage output vs the guy with the higher AC is going to be more important than damage output vs. the guys with the lower AC, but this
    is obviously not always true.
    </li>
	<li>
	Usually, the benefit scales linearly with inspire courage bonus, but there are cases where that’s not accurate. For example, if a character has an attack
    of +5 and average damage of 10, you see dragonfire inspiration be the better choice if the inspire courage bonus is 1 to 4, but at 5 the advantage starts
    to decline, and at 7, inspire courage becomes stronger again.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Bottom line is this. If you understand the math, you can decide to use this when it makes sense, and use inspire courage otherwise. If you can do that,
    you’ll get a pretty solid boost to damage on average. I’ve created an excel spreadsheet which will help you simulate certain situations, so you can get a
    feel for the numbers.

    </a>
</p>
<h4>Does Dragonfire Inspiration stack with Inspire Courage? </h4>
<p>
    If I was DM, I would rule no. My reading of the rules suggest that you cannot stack these two effects, but some people disagree. This isn’t 100% clear
because the section I depend on for my ruling is specifically talking about spells, and inspire courage is not a spell. Here is that section:
</p>
<blockquote>
    (Rule Compendium 137) – “The same spell can sometimes produce varying effects if applied to the same recipient more than once. Usually the last spell in
    the series trumps the others. one of the previous spells are actually removed or dispelled, but their effects become irrelevant while the final spell in
    the series lasts”.
</blockquote>
<p>
    The fact that it’s the same ability providing the effect makes me believe that it does not stack. Talk to your DM, and find out. If it does stack, this
    feat is a whole lot stronger than what I’ve said here.

<h3>Items</h3>
<p>
    There are <strong>a lot</strong> of viable items in this game. I won’t be able to do a complete list, but I will try to cover the high points of
    bard-specific items, and items that are especially good for bards.
</p>
<p>
    Pro-tip: the most powerful item you’ll probably be able to find in the game is the one your DM invents for you. A little gentle encouragement can go a long
    way here. In my experience, DMs love inventing magical items, and their sense of ownership tends to cause them to make it a powerful one.
</p>
<h4>General Use</h4>
<ul>
	<li class="rank-c">
        <strong>150 - Elixir of Love (DMG)</strong> – This is a cool little potion to carry with you for almost no cost. Charm person if you can get them to drink it.  
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>Wand of Cure Light Wounds (DMG)</strong> – Never leave home without one. 
    </li>
	<li class="rank-a">
        <strong>2000 - Heward’s Handy Haversack (DMG)</strong> – As you’ll see below, I recommend carrying a veritable symphony of instruments. Where are you going to put all of these instruments for easy access? A
        handy haversack! Fix carry weight and draw any item as a move action. Yes please. 
    </li>
	<li class="rank-b">
        <strong>4000 - Cloak of Charisma (+2) (DMG)</strong> – Any item that pumps charisma is going to be a really good item for a bard. More spells, higher DCs, and better social skills. Yes please!
    </li>

</ul>
<h4>Mundane Instruments</h4>
<p>
    All masterwork instruments give a +2 bonus to perform. In addition, the following instruments give the additional benefits as outlined below. You should
    carry almost all of these on you, once you have the carry capacity. The cost is so low.
</p>
<ul>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>100 – Masterwork Drum</strong> 
        (Cadv 124) – +1 to Inspire Courage Damage, -1 to Inspire Courage Charm and Fear. This is worth carrying. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>100 – Masterwork Fiddle</strong>
(Cadv 124) – +1 to IC charm &amp; fear (scales with level) and cast spells while performing, as long as those spells have only vocal components.        
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>100 – Masterwork Flute</strong>
        (Cadv 124) – +2 to countersong. I mean, I guess you can carry this if you have countersong, but get rid of countersong. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>100 – Masterwork Harp</strong>
        (Cadv 124) – Target one additional creature with fascinate or inspire greatness. Definitely worth carrying this item. Also allows you to cast
        verbal-only spells while performing. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>100 – Masterwork Horn</strong>
        (Cadv 124) – Raise IC damage and fear by 1, but effect stops 1 round after the ally stops hearing the performance. Drum is better. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>100 – Masterwork Lute</strong>
        (Cadv 124) – Lets you cast while performing, as long as the spell only requires vocal components. Also get +1 level when determining the effect of your
        bardic musics. This is useful at most levels (3, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20) for various reasons: 
    </li>
	<ul>
	<li>
	<strong>Inspire Courage</strong>: Increase bonus by 1 at levels 3, 7, 13, and 19; 
	</li>
	<li>
	<strong>Fascinate</strong>: gain an extra target at levels 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 (also helps mass suggestion); 
	</li>
	<li>
    <strong>Inspire Greatness</strong>: An additional target at levels 11, 14, 17; and
	</li>
	<li>
    <strong>Inspire Heroics:</strong> an extra target at levels 17 and 20.
	</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>100 – Masterwork Lyre</strong>
(Cadv 124) – An additional target for fascinate or inspire heroics. Also lets you cast while playing, as long as the spell only has vocal components.        
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>100 – Masterwork Mandolin</strong>
        (Cadv 124) – Can cast while performing as long as spell only uses vocal components. Inspire Courage gets +1 to attack, but -1 damage and charm and
        fear. Bleh. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>100 – Masterwork Pan Pipes</strong>
        (Cadv 124) – +1 to fascinate and +1 to suggestion DC. Not bad, worth carrying. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>100 – Bagpipes (</strong>
        SaS 43<strong>)</strong> – Give all listeners -1 against fear effects.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>100 – Banjolele</strong>
        (SaS 43) –Increase bonus of IC fear by 1.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>100 – Bones</strong> 
        (SaS 43) –Listeners get -2 against fear effects. Not great, but if you have a use, the cost is very low. It costs a standard action
        to activate, so not usually going to be good in combat, unless the DM rules that it stacks with other bardic music effects, which I think is a
        reasonable reading of the rules. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>100 – Fiddle (SaS 44), Lap Harp</strong> 
        (SaS 46), <strong>Lute</strong>(SaS 46) <strong></strong> – Lets a bard maintain two bardic music effects at one time (inspire courage and inspire
        greatness, I’m looking at you).
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>100 – Handbell</strong> 
        (SAS 45) - +1 bonus to countersong attempts. If you’re countersonging ever, get the Whistle-Pipe instead, it gives +5. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-a">
        <strong>100 – Harmonica (SaS 45), Shawm (SaS 49)</strong> 
       – Now this is a good item. +4 to bluff, diplomacy, gather information, and disguise checks vs. people who heard you perform for 1d6 hours after the
        performance AND it shifts the listener’s attitude one level closer to you. This is effectively like a +20 to diplomacy. If I am a DM, I’m seriously
        considering not allowing this item to exist. If your DM allows it, my god it’s good. Alternatively, get someone to helpful through normal diplomacy,
        and then turn them fanatic with this harmonica with no chance of failure. Are you kidding me? 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-a">
        <strong>100 – Horn, Natural (</strong>
        SaS 46) – Increase inspire courage bonus by 1, but reduce charm effects by 2. Yes please. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>100 – Lyre</strong> – 
        (SaS 47) - +2 to countersong, fascinate, or suggestion against fey. Meh. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>100 – Pan-Pipes (</strong>
        SaS 48) - +1 to perform when listeners are animal or fey. Yuck, just get masterwork. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>100 – Recorder Flute</strong> 
(SaS 48)– Listener gets -1 against charm and compulsion, including fascinate and suggestion. Worth carrying for sure.        
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>100 – Whistle Pipe</strong> 
        (SAS 49) - +5 bonus to countersong attempts. If you’re countersonging ever, this helps for a low cost. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>100 – Zither</strong> 
        (SaS 49)–IC: resist charm and fear increases, but damage decreases. Yuck. 
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Magical Instruments</h4>
<p>
    All magical instruments are masterwork. I think there’s a reasonable argument to be made that any magical Lyre instrument also gets the benefits listed
    above in mundane instruments, but you’ll have to convince your DM.
</p>
<ul>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>1000 - Drums of Marching (HoB 131)</strong> – 
        Those nearby get a +4 to con checks during forced marches. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>1000 - Horn of Volume (MH)</strong> – 
        Your allies can hear you from twice as far away. I’ve never met a DM who strictly enforced distances on bardic music, and only double isn’t that
        exciting. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>1350 - Instrument of the Bards - Fochluchan Bandore</strong> 
        (MIC 161, CArc 148)<strong></strong>  - +2 to perform, +1 to fascinate, countersong, and suggestion, light 1/day, flare, mending, message 1/day.
        Requires 2 ranks in stringed instruments for some of the abilities. Not a bad way to get a wide range of shallow benefits for a low price. The MIC
        price is lower than the CArc.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>2100 - Instrument of the Bards - Mac-Fuirmidh Cithern</strong> 
        (CArc 149, MIC 163)- +2 to perform, +2 to countersong, fascinate, and suggestion. If you have 4 ranks in string instruments, cast
        CLW, Mage Armor, and Sleep 1/day. I don’t love the skill requirement, but the effects aren’t bad. Sleep is kind of wasted, and CLW is probably going to
        be on a wand. Not a bad item, but not amazing. The MIC has the price lower than CArc.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>3000 - Bagpipes of the Damned</strong> 
        (LM 78) – DC 15 Perform (wind instrument) – All Undead get a +4 resistance to being turned for 10 rounds. Maybe if you’re a necromancer or have a
        necromancer in your party? Even then, not great. The cost is pretty minor, though. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>3000 - Lyre of the Restless Soul (LM)</strong> – 
        Makes all undead get -4 to turning with a DC 15 perform check. Not going to be worth doing, usually, and not worth the gold. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>3600 - Horn of Rallying</strong>
        (HoB 132)- +10 to rally troops (a feature from HoB). Yuck.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>4000 - Biwa of Kakita</strong>
        (OA 137) - +4 to perform lute. Nothing exciting, especially because it inhibits the use of other magical instruments. Most magical instruments already
        give +2 to perform, which would stack with the mithral bells +2, so I’d rather have those. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>4100 - Instrument of the Bards - Doss Lute</strong>
        (CArc 149)<strong></strong>  -  +2 to perform, +3 to countersong, fascinate, and suggestion. Delay Posion, hold person, and mirror image 1/day. Gives
        negative levels to anyone who doesn’t have 6 ranks in perform. I don’t love any of these spells, but the cost isn’t bad. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>4100 - Methild's Harp</strong> 
        (MoF 162) - +2 to performance,unlocks stuff. If you don’t have a rogue, this is a cool item to solve the locked-door problem. Can
        even get through some magical locks. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>5000 – Horn of Resiliance</strong> 
        (MIC 209) –Grant DR 5 / - for all allies in a 30’ radius. 30’ is a little low for distance. Also grant 50 temporary hit points when
        inspiring greatness. Not amazing, not bad. It’s also a masterwork horn, which should be subject to the rules outlined above.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>5400 - Rhingalade's Harp</strong> 
        (MoF 165) - +2 to performance, turn on blink and mirror image at the same time. Getting two spells for the cost of one action is nice, and it doesn’t
        provoke an attack of opportunity. This is worth considering as an item. It’s a shame it only gets 1 use per day. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>6800 - Esheen's Harp</strong>
        (MoF 157) - +2 to perform, +5 to listen against creatures carrying metal or glass, shatter 1/day. Very expensive for weak abilities. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>7000 - Night Caller (LM 79)</strong> – 
        Animate zombies once per week. Max 2 zombies. Pretty cool and price effective, especially for a necromancer-bard. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>7185 - Trumpet of Doom</strong> 
        (BoED 116) – Nearby evil creatures become shaken for one minute, DC 14 save. Shaken isn’t a great ability, but not bad. This would be OK at low levels
        for non-melee bards, when you don’t have a ton of spells. Not great at higher levels due to the low save.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>7500 - Biwa of Calm</strong> 
        (OA 137) – Calm emotions on a 30’ radius, DC 15. Not a bad price to get a free spell. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>8100 - Instrument of the Bards - Canaith Mandolin (</strong>
        MIC 153) <strong></strong> - +2 to perform, +4 to countersong, fascinate, and suggestion. Cure Serious Wounds, Dispel Magic, or Summon Monster III.
        Requires 8 ranks in perform (string) for the better effects. This is a solid item if you have the skill ranks. I don’t know if it’s worth putting skill
        ranks in strings just for this item, though. (CArc 149 has it for a much higher price. At the MIC price, it’s pretty good). 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>8500 - Valarde's Harp</strong> 
        (MoF 166) - +2 to perform. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>10000 - Yeth Horn</strong> 
        (Planar 84)<strong></strong> – 60’ spread, DC15 perform check to activate. All creatures except evil outsiders have to pass a DC16 will or be panicked
        for 2d6 rounds. The will save is a little low for the price, but the effect is almost-phenomenal. Would be a solid item for a level 7-12 character. The
        big downside here is that affects everyone except evil outsiders. A huge downside that can’t really be overcome. This is better for a DM than a player,
        most of the time. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>12000 - Janthra's Harp</strong> 
        (MoF 161) - +2 to perform, invisibility sphere for 1 hour / day. Effectively unlimited uses. Very strong. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>12100 – Dove’s Harp (MIC 156) - +2 to perform,</strong> 
        all allies get fast healing 3 for 1 minute (they heal 3 HP per round).My reading is that it piggy-backs another bardic music (like
        inspire courage). If so, this is solid.That’s a lot of damage healing for no additional actions. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>13000 – Lyre of Building (DMG)</strong> – 
Protect a structure from destruction, or get the equivalent of 100 humans worth of work in 3 days. There are a lot of creative uses for this item.        
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>15000 - Ruehar's Flute</strong> 
(PGtF 124) – Some small magical effects, plus comes with some spells like a spellbook. Not great for a bard; we don’t have any use for spellbooks.        
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>16000 - Azlaer's Harp (MoF 154)</strong> – 
        Calm emotions and suppress charm, plus a light effect. Way too expensive for its limited application.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>18000 - Horn of the Rider</strong> – 
        <strong>lesser</strong> 
        (HoB 132) –Summons a rider 3 times / day that deal damage and threaten to trample opponents. They only last one attack. It’s
        effectively a blasting spell 3/day. Not bad, not great. Price is high. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>18100 - Instrument of the Bards - Cli Lyre</strong> 
        (MIC 154) - +2 to perform, +5 to countersong, fascinate, and suggestion. Break Enchantment, dimension door, and shout each 1/day. Requires 10 ranks in
        strings. This is good. (CArc has a higher price). 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>22000 - Instrument of the Winds</strong> 
(PGtF) - +2 to perform, DC 15 wind instrument check. If it succeeds, summon an air elemental. Definitely a strong effect for the price.        
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>22300 - Nithanalor's Harp</strong> 
        (MoF 164) - +2 to perform, 1/day stone skin. A wand of stoneskin costs 50% more. Not bad. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>25000 – Handharp</strong> 
        (MoF 159)<strong></strong> – A handful of cool abilities, focused on the undead. Not worth getting unless the undead stuff is helpful for you, but I
        like that it’s diverse. A wand of dimension door would be 21,000 and would burn out eventually. This never dies and gives other effects too. A solid
        item, albeit not good for every bard. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>32100 – Instrument of the Bards - Anstruth Harp</strong>
        (MIC 150) -<strong> Anstruth Harp</strong> (CArc 149) - +2 to perform, +6 to countersong, fascinate, and suggestion. Control Water, Mass CLW, and Mind
        fog. I really don’t like this version. CArc has it listed for 60000, Magic Item Compendium has it at 32100. At the MIC price it’s not terrible, but not
        great. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>35380 - Horn of Triumph</strong> 
        (SaS 56) –+2 Morale bonus to saving throws, attacks, damage, strength, constitution, ability checks, and skill checks. -1 to AC. It’s
        a real shame this is a morale bonus, which keeps it from stacking with inspire courage. Creatures also must remain with 15’ of activation, which is a
        severe limitation. Works twice / day. The limitations set this far back. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>36750 - Drums of Thunder</strong> – 
        A limited number of charges, has a handful of good spells on it. Because it’s charged based (and you only get 10-20 activations) I’m not in love with
        this item. That’s a lot of gold for an item that decays. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>45100 - Dove's Harp</strong>
        (MoF 156) -+2 to performance checks, cure insanity, calm emotions, CLW, and light. Not great and very expensive. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>60000 - Horn of the Rider - greater</strong> 
        (HoB 132) – Summons three riders, 3 times per day, that deal damage and threaten to trample opponents. They only last one attack. It’s effectively a
        blasting spell 3/day. Not bad, not great. Price is high.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>75000 - Horn of Dragons</strong> 
        (Drac 121)<strong></strong> – Can only be used once a month, but lets you summon a ******* dragon who will help you to the best of his ability. This is
        super cool. Probably not worth getting, but my god it’s cool. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>50100 - Instrument of the Bards - Ollamh Harp</strong> 
        (CArc 149, MIC 166) - +2 to perform, +7 to countersong, fascinate, and suggestion. Control Weather, Eyebite, and repulsion 1/day. I don’t love these
        spells. MIC has it for less than CArc.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>84000 - Hwyrr - the Clarion Harp</strong> – 
        (BoED 117) – An intelligent item. Automatically inhibits attacks of opportunity in bad guys, grants some other spells per day. I think this is
        overpriced.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>84375 - Gong of Dispelling</strong> 
        (OA 141)<strong></strong> – A giant gong which must be hung, has 50 charges, and dispels evil and magic in a 30’ radius. Way too expensive and
        unwieldy. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>115440 - Trumpet of Healing</strong> 
        (BoED 116) – Heal 1/day (solves almost all problems, including up to 150 HP), and has a handful of other spells which can be cast 3/day. The cost is a
        bit steep for a trumped-up healing wand. <strong><u></u></strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Weapons</h4>
<ul>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>4310 – Crystal Echoblade (MIC 49)</strong> – 
        A +1 longsword that deals extra sonic damage equal to your bard level. Very, very good, and priced low. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>12330 - Bow of Songs (MIC 48)</strong> 
        - +1 shortbow that also lets you expend a bardic music to get extra attack and damage. I like this for mid-level archer bards. 
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Weapon Enhancements</h4>
<ul>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>+1 Bonus – Harmonizing (MIC 34)</strong>  - 
        +2 to perform (sing). Sustains your bardic musics for you until you do something that stops it. Pretty good, not essential. <strong><u></u></strong>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>+1 Bonus – Holy Surge (MIC 36)</strong> – 
        Get a big bonus damage to evil creatures, CHA times per day. Not great, but maybe worth considering for a melee bard. <strong><u></u></strong>
    </li>
    <li style="background-color: #ff0" >
        <strong>+1 Bonus – Stunning (MIC 44)</strong>
    </li>
    <li style="background-color: #ff0" >
        <strong>+1 Bonus – Stunning Surge (MIC 44)</strong> 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>+1 Bonus – Warning (MIC 46)</strong>  - 
        +5 to initiative. Going first is important for a buffer / battlefield controller. 
    </li>
    <li>
        
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Armor</h4>
<ul>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>1100 – Mithril Chain</strong>
        (DMG 220) – Light Chain Shirt. <strong><u></u></strong>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>3450 – Mithralmist Shirt (</strong>
        MIC 20) - +1 Mithril Shirt, 7/day get concealment against attacks for one minute. <strong><u></u></strong>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>4150 – Elven Chain</strong>
        (DMG) –Light Chainmail, -2 ACP. <strong><u></u></strong>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>13100 – Kyton Armor</strong> 
        (MIC 19) – Get an extra 1d6 damage attack per turn, as a swift action. Not great for the price.<strong> <u></u></strong>
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>22400 - Celestial Armor</strong> 
        (DMG) -+3 chainmail that grants fly 1 / day. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-e">
        <strong>25400 - Breastplate of Command</strong> 
(DMG) – Gives +2 to all charisma checks and +2 to leadership. It’s alright, but is medium armor, which makes our spell fail 25%. Pass.        
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Armor Enhancements</h4>
<ul>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>1200 – Commander</strong>
        (MIC 9) - +2 on diplomacy, allies get +1 to will saves, -5 to hide. This is a cheap way to pump diplomacy inexpensively. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>2700 – Glammered (DMG 219)</strong> – 
        Armor can change to look like normal clothing. Not bad for disguise people.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>5000 – Quickness (MIC 13)</strong> – 
        Increase movement by 5’. Good for melee bards. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>6000 – Speed (MIC 14)</strong> – 
        Haste yourself for 1 round, three times per day. 
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Wondrous Items</h4>
<ul>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>400 – Charm of Countersong</strong> 
        (MIC 85)<strong></strong> – Lets you activate countersong as an immediate action. Countersong should just work this way. Given that it doesn’t, this
        turns countersong from an absolutely terrible ability to something that’s at least usable. I wish it didn’t consume a neck slot, but it costs next to
        nothing. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-a">
        <strong>1200 - Badge of Valor</strong>
        (MIC 207)<strong></strong> – 3 activations per day. Grant bonuses to saves or +1 to the nextinspire courage, activate as swift
        action. This is a great item for a really low cost. The only reason not to have this is because you need the neck slot for something better at really
        high levels. (It’s actually worth considering getting the entire regalia of the hero set; the cost is low and the benefits are solid).
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>1600 – Headband of the Lorebinder</strong>
        (MIC 110) -+4 bonus to bardic knowledge checks, and read magic 3 / day. Not bad, and a good price, but you’ve got better things to do
        with the headslot. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>3100 – Pipes of Frenzied Revelry</strong> – 
        (MIC 168)- +5 to perform by themselves. If you activate the “relic power”, you get to send everyone around you into an amorous
        confusion. Not great because it has to hit your allies as well. But the price is really great.
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>3100 – Chime of Harmonic Agony</strong> 
        (MIC 154) – This is a fine item for early-mid levels, giving the bard some damage output. 3d6 + CHA mod is pretty good damage for one standard action,
        and there’s no save!
    </li>
    <li class="rank-c">
        <strong>3700 - Mithral Bells</strong> 
        (MIC 111) – A bracelet of 11 mithril bells. As long as there are at least 2, you get +2 to perform checks. In addition, you can throw a bell up to 40’,
        and it explodes as a Sound Burst effect. Not bad, a little pricey. It’s good at low levels, but doesn’t make a ton of sense at low levels. I wonder if
        you can get a discount one with just two bells left. +2 to perform for 1000 gold doesn’t sound bad. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>4400 - Sacred Scabbard</strong>
(MIC 182) – Three times a day, bless your weapon as a swift while its drawn, lasts 10 rounds. Price is good, casting time is good, effect is good.        
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>12000 – Mantle of Second Chances</strong> 
        (MIC 115) –Reroll as an immediate action, before knowing the result, once per day. Good effect, but too expensive. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>15000</strong> – 
        <strong>Desperation Chain</strong>
        (MIC 93) – Goes around the waist. Allows you to cast a spell as an immediate action and without verbal and somatic components when you’re about to die
        or being disabled by an opponent (pinned, etc.) This is very strong. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-b">
        <strong>16000 - Vest of Legends</strong> 
        (DMG2)<strong></strong> – +5 to diplomacy and perform; bard level counts as 5 levels higher for inspire courage, fascinate, inspire greatness, and
        inspire heroics. Very good. 
    </li>
    <li class="rank-d">
        <strong>27000 - Mantle of the Silver Dragon</strong>
        (Drac 121) - +2 to Charisma, fly 1/day. Not bad, but very expensive for the effect.
