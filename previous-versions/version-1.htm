the Bard</B></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><B>I think bard is
one of the most balanced, dynamic, and fun classes to play in the
game.</B> I didn’t appreciate how many options and abilities were
available to it until I dug into the various source books. This class
is AWESOME.  Sure, you don’t have the raw power of the nuclear
classes, but you can be in a party with other tier 2-5 classes and
really shine. He can be adapted to a bunch of different play styles:
caster, gish (sword-mage), arcane archer, face, crowd control, skill
monkey, and healer. He can usually fill a number of those roles at
the same time, and does so effectively. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I have played a
lot of different characters, and the bard is by far the most fun I’ve
had. Wizards and things like the DMM Cleric possess campaign
shattering nuclear power, but that’s not fun. The bard is what D&amp;D
should be: dynamic, rewards creative play, powerful without being
over-powered, and his abilities are friendly to other PCs. I cannot
recommend the class enough, especially for your next low- or
mid-powered campaign. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The class rewards
tight and creative play and building. It is everything I enjoy in a
game, and I hope this handbook helps you enjoy it as well.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT SIZE=5><B>Why
I Wrote this Handbook</B></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">There is another
good bard’s handbook on the net:
<A HREF="http://community.wizards.com/forum/previous-editions-character-optimization/threads/1145396">http://community.wizards.com/forum/previous-editions-character-optimization/threads/1145396</A>.
That guide was the baseline for my research into the class, but I
found that it was missing a good bit of information, so I wanted to
write a comprehensive handbook. That being said, the original
handbook is a great resource, and I recommend reading that one as
well as this one to get multiple view points. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">In addition, there’s
a series of articles titled “Bardzilla” (I, II, and III) which
are also a good source to read:
<A HREF="https://incontrol88.wordpress.com/2010/08/09/bardzilla/">https://incontrol88.wordpress.com/2010/08/09/bardzilla/</A>.
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Another good
handbook to read is Treantmonk’s Guide to Being God (aka a wizard),
and his threads on the various wizard spells:
<A HREF="http://community.wizards.com/forum/previous-editions-character-optimization/threads/1146876">http://community.wizards.com/forum/previous-editions-character-optimization/threads/1146876</A>.
Although this doesn’t directly apply to the bard, the concept he
talks about are great and do apply, and his review of spells helped
form the spell review at the bottom of this handbook.

are typically unbalanced and should be reviewed with a critical eye

Note on Ability Evaluation and Character Optimization</B></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Many people focus on
only level 20 only when they design characters. I recommend doing
more than that. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">If your campaign is
anything like the games I’ve ever played, you start at low levels,
slowly progress through the mid levels, and, if you’re lucky, you
get to play some teen levels before the game falls apart.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Even if you have a
dedicated play group an make it all the way to level 20, the
abilities you get at levels 1-5 are going to get <B>a lot </B>more
play than the abilities you get at levels 15-20. Keep that in mind
while designing your character. I recommend that you look at the
build every four levels (or at specific key levels, depending on your
class) and consider how you’d like the character at each of those
level. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">If you know
you’re going to start playing at a high level and continue to play
after reaching level 20, then of course this does not apply to you.
But for most people, level 1-10 are much more important than levels
11-20. Make sure you keep that in mind while developing your
character. Remember; the goal isn’t to optimize some theoretical
mechanic; the goal is to optimize fun.

points to pick up “skill tricks”, which are effectively
mini-feats. Due to the high number of skill points and many roles
that a Bard can play in a party, skill tricks can be a nice resource
for a bard. Typically, you want to choose skill tricks that suit your

be able to get some use out of the trick, it’s generally worth
taking. Here is a list and my opinions on each:

	– Charm of Countersong </B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#4f81bd">(MIC 85)</FONT><FONT COLOR="#4f81bd"><B>
	– </B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#4f81bd">Lets you activate countersong
	as an immediate action. Countersong should just work this way. Given
	that it doesn’t, this turns countersong from an absolutely
	terrible ability to something that’s at least usable. I wish it
	didn’t consume a neck slot, but it costs next to nothing. </FONT>

	- Badge of Valor</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#8064a2"> (MIC 207)</FONT><FONT COLOR="#8064a2"><B>
	– </B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#8064a2">3 activations per day. Grant
	bonuses to saves or +1 to the next</FONT><FONT COLOR="#8064a2"><B>
	</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#8064a2">inspire courage, activate as swift
	action. This is a great item for a really low cost. The only reason
	not to have this is because you need the neck slot for something
	better at really high levels. (It’s actually worth considering
	getting the entire regalia of the hero set; the cost is low and the
	benefits are solid).</FONT></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><B>1600 –
	Headband of the Lorebinder</B> (MIC 110) -<B> </B>+4 bonus to bardic
	knowledge checks, and read magic 3 / day. Not bad, and a good price,
	but you’ve got better things to do with the headslot.

	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><B>3100 –
	Pipes of Frenzied Revelry – </B>(MIC 168)<B> </B>- +5 to perform
	by themselves. If you activate the “relic power”, you get to
	send everyone around you into an amorous confusion. Not great
	because it has to hit yoru allies as well. But the price is really
	great.<B> </B>

	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT COLOR="#4f81bd"><B>3100
	– Chime of Harmonic Agony </B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#4f81bd">(MIC
	154) – This is a fine item for early-mid levels, giving the bard
	some damage output. 3d6 + CHA mod is pretty good damage for one
	standard action, and there’s no save!</FONT></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><B>3700 -
	Mithral Bells </B>(MIC 111) – A bracelet of 11 mithril bells. As
	long as there are at least 2, you get +2 to perform checks. In
	addition, you can throw a bell up to 40’, and it explodes as a
	Sound Burst effect. Not bad, a little pricey. It’s good at low
	levels, but doesn’t make a ton of sense at low levels. I wonder if
	you can get a discount one with just two bells left. +2 to perform
	for 1000 gold doesn’t sound bad.

	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT COLOR="#4f81bd"><B>4400
	- Sacred Scabbard</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#4f81bd"> (MIC 182) –
	Three times a day, bless your weapon as a swift while its drawn,
	lasts 10 rounds. Price is good, casting time is good, effect is
	good. </FONT>

	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><B>5000 –
	Horn of Resiliance </B>(MIC 209) –<B> </B>Grant DR 5 / - for all
	allies in a 30’ radius. 30’ is a little low for distance. Also
	grant 50 temporary hit points when inspiring greatness. Not amazing,
	not bad.

	as an immediate action, before knowing the result, once per day.
	Good effect, but too expensive. </FONT>

	waist. Allows you to cast a spell as an immediate action and without
	verbal and somantic components when you’re about to die or being
	disabled by an opponent (pinned, etc.) This is very strong.  </FONT>
